<p>Institutional investors, under pressure to raise their exposure to soaring British financial stocks, are likely to continue to chase the sector higher in coming weeks, dealers and strategists said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Institutions are scrambling to increase or at least maintain their weightings in financials,&quot; said one London dealer.</p>
<p>The unprecedented squeeze in bank stocks has spilled into the insurance sector, pushing shares such as Legal &amp; General Plc, Prudential Corp Plc and Commercial Union Plc to fresh peaks.</p>
<p>&quot;Even the second-line insurance shares are getting squeezed,&quot; another dealer added. &quot;It's filtering all the way down.&quot;</p>
<p>Building society flotations and bid speculation have galvanised the British financial stocks, which have helped propel the FTSE 100 into uncharted territory.</p>
<p>And dealers said there's little chance of the sector suffering a significant correction until the Halifax, Britain's largest mortgage lender, floats its shares in June. Next month also sees the flotation of mutually-owned insurer Norwich Union.</p>
<p>Shares in major UK banks --  more than half of them sitting at record levels -- have almost become too expensive to attract takeover bids, a dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;But the speculation will continue,&quot; he said. &quot;The bank sector has really overheated, but with Halifax (flotation) coming up, I think there are still more (gains) to come.&quot;</p>
<p>Shares in Royal Bank of Scotland soared by some nine percent on Friday amid talk that HSBC Holdings might launch a bid.</p>
<p>Talk that Barclays Plc or National Westminster Bank Plc might bid for the newly floated Alliance &amp; Leicester Plc heightened expectations of more consolidation in the industry and buoyed the entire British bank sector, dealers said.</p>
<p>Mark Tinker, UK equity strategist with UBS, noted that once the building society flotations are completed this summer, financial stocks will represent 20 percent of the total market by capitalisation.</p>
<p>&quot;Financial companies are 20 percent of the economy, so it's just catching up to reflect reality,&quot; Tinker said.</p>
<p>&quot;The risk a fund manager is taking by not having a substantial weighing is too large in the current environment,&quot; Tinker added.</p>
