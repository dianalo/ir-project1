<p>Irish bonds made strong gains in moderate volumes of trade on Wednesday as strong overseas interest pushed up prices, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;We've seen a good performance from the long papers today. The 10-year has doubled its gains since morning. We're seeing a lot of foreign buyers in the Dublin market because long bonds are considered a cheap buy at the moment,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>By 1520 GMT the 8.00 percent bond due 2000 had risen 28p to 104.09 to yield 6.71 percent while the 8.00 percent bond due 2006 had risen 60p to 103.45 to yield 7.36 percent.  </p>
<p>On Tuesday Ireland's National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) said its competitive auction of 75 million punts of the 8.25 percent bond due 2015 had been covered 4.21 times.</p>
<p>&quot;Tuesday's auction was well subscribed and injected some positive sentiment into the market,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;The whole U.S./Iraq military situation could throw up something overnight and cause ripples in markets on Thursday morning,&quot; the dealer added.</p>
<p>Dealers said Irish market awaited the U.S. beige book at 1600 GMT on Wednesday and Irish CPI inflation data on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect a CPI figure of 1.6 percent inflation year-on-year. The figure would need to be wildly stronger than that to have a real impact on the market,&quot; the dealer said.</p>
