<title>THAILAND: Thai stocks end down after foreign trades curbed.</title>

<p>Thai stocks closed sharply lower on Tuesday on foreign selling following the Bank of Thailand's measures to prevent offshore parties from raising baht through the bourse, brokers said.</p>
<p>The SET index closed 7.24 points or 1.35 percent lower at 527.22 on 3.85 billion baht turnover. The SET-50 index was down 0.63 to 37.52.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a complete uneasiness. This is quite negative,&quot; said one analyst at a foreign brokerage.</p>
<p>&quot;(Foreign) investors are even more concerned that whatever they do here, it is not very good for business because authorities can change regulations anytime they want,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>The Bank of Thailand said had asked institutions providing custodian service not to transfer unpaid stocks among foreigners in a measure to curb efforts by speculators to raise baht funds through short sales.</p>
<p>The central bank also required foreigners dealing in Thai stocks to settle in US dollars only, said an official of the Securities and Exchange Commission which regulates the bourse.</p>
<p>The moves would be temporary and aimed at curbing baht supplies to foreign currency speculators who had attacked on baht last month and were now desperate to acquire the currency to cover short positions.  </p>
<p>Lingering worries about the non-performing loans problem in the finance sector, especially among finance firms, also triggered sustained foreign selling, brokers said.</p>
<p>But bargain hunting in the bank sector which rose 1.5 percent helped limit market losses, they added.</p>
<p>Bangkok Bank rose three baht to 149 on the most active trade of 713.5 million baht.</p>
<p>Dusit Thani, a major hotel operator, dropped 0.25 baht to 17. The company said on Tuesday it would sell 25 million new shares to U.S. investment house Goldman Sachs at 30 baht each for a total of 750 million baht.</p>
