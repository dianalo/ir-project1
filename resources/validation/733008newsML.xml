<headline>India rupee ends steady v dlr after early RBI bid.</headline>

<p>The rupee ended steady at 35.705/710 against the dollar after the market forced an early intervention by the central bank to halt the rupee's rise above the 35.70-mark, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;People were caught long yesterday,&quot; said a dealer. &quot;Everyone had expected the RBI (Reserve Bank of India) to come in earlier -- we could not sell enough as RBI came in late.&quot;</p>
<p>The State Bank of India (SBI), India's leading bank, was in a buying mood, absorbing sizeable amounts of dollars at 35.700. Some leading foreign banks were sellers, dealers said.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the RBI bought in the last half-hour of trading sessions, which enabled it to reverse the rising rupee tide without large purchases, dealers said.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the RBI was forced to intervene before 1500 hours local (0930 GMT), buying over $60 million, dealers said.</p>
<p>After RBI struck, SBI stepped up its bids to 35.71 from 35.70 rupees earlier, absorbing lots of supplies, dealers said.</p>
<p>SBI later brought down its bids to end the day at the closing rate of 35.70/71, they said.</p>
<p>One dealer said the RBI's purchase price showed a downtrend, which did not augur well for market participants. RBI's dollar purchase price fell to 35.71 on Wednesday from 35.73 on Monday.</p>
<p>On Monday and Tuesday, RBI stepped in after the rupee breached the 35.70 mark, but on Wednesday, it pre-empted the crash through its early intervention, dealers said.</p>
<p>The six-month annualised forward premium closed Wednesday at 3.53 percent, little changed from the previous 3.52 percent.</p>
