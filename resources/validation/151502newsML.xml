<p>The European Parliament's environment committee is due to say on October 30 that European Union states should be bound by much stricter environmental protection laws.</p>
<p>The committee is expected to approve a report by Belgian Green Paul Lannoye which demands substantial improvements to a draft directive -- COM(93)575 -- whose aim is to tighten up a 1985 European Union law on environmental impact studies.</p>
<p>The full parliament is expected to back the call at its November 13 plenary session in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>EU environement ministers reached a common position on the proposal in July but, as Lannoye's report points out, the Council has omitted a string of elements recommended by the European Commission and by MEPs, who gave the prposal a first reading last October.</p>
<p>Lannoye's report says the scope of the draft directive, as it stands, is too narrow. It allows member states to approve all defence projects, and far too many intensive farming and electrification schemes, without first studying their impact on the environment.</p>
<p>The directive permits far too many derogations and inadvisably leaves it up to individual member states to decide what constitutes an environmentally sensitive area, the report says.</p>
<p>Studies to assess the environmental impact of both private and public projects are compulsory in such sensitive areas.</p>
<p>The Green MEP is also indignant about the member states' refusal both to inform and consult the public more extensively before projects go ahead and to monitor their effect on the environment while they are in progress.</p>
<p>Council's rejection of the &quot;zero option&quot; -- the decision not to go ahead with a project at all if all the possible options prove to be environmentally unsound -- is also a sore point with the Greens.</p>
<p>Lannoye is demanding improvements on all these fronts, as well as guarantees that any experts the member states commission to carry out environmental impact studies are entirely independent and suitably qualified.</p>
<p>The draft directive needs the support of both ministers and MEPs to come into force.</p>
