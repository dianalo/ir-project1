<p>Following is an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of Feyenoord and Ajax Amsterdam who meet in the Dutch first division in Rotterdam on Sunday (1700 gmt):</p>
<p>FEYENOORD:</p>
<p>Playing style: Coach Arie Haan has experimented with different formations but appears to have settled on a 4-4-2 system built around hard work. Like the Dutch national side, he employs twin strikers -- Swede Henryk Larsson and Argentine Pablo Sanchez -- with Gaston Taument and Giovanni van Bronckhorst playing deeper on the flanks. In defence, two players operate as man-markers, allowing Ronald Koeman to push forward and, with Kees van Wonderen, prompt the attack.</p>
<p>Strengths: Team spirit, hard work and a never-say-die attitude. Physically, they are a tough side, hard to break down and keen to give as good as they get. Koeman is pivotal in reading the game and in turning defence into attack with strong and precise passing. Keeper Ed de Goey's constant performances are an asset when Koeman has an off-day.</p>
<p>Weaknesses: Depth and indiscipline. Feyenoord have up to a dozen players of similar strength and experience but doubts creep in when one or two of those elements in the team are missing. Indiscipline has cost too many yellow and red cards. Concentration can go famously awry as in the bizarre 7-2 top-of-the-table thrashing by PSV Eindhoven last month.</p>
<p>Motivation: A full-house and a nine-point cushion against arch-rivals Ajax is all fans could want. Envious of Ajax's recent successes, the Rotterdam fans will enjoy rubbing salt in the already deep wounds.</p>
<p>Line-up (from): Ed de Goey, Clemens Zwijnenberg, Geoffrey Claeys, Henk Fraser, Ronald Koeman, Bernard Schuiteman, George Boateng; Kees van Wonderen, Giovanni van Bronckhorst, Pablo Sanchez, Gaston Taument, Hendryk Larsson, Tomek Iwan.</p>
<p>AJAX AMSTERDAM:</p>
<p>Playing style: A flexible 4-3-3 formation based on technical excellence where a striker can happily play at left-back and a midfielder as libero. Reading and understanding the game is crucial but possession is key, with patient build-up out of defence, good movement off the ball and rarely a wasted pass in excess of 15 metres. Both full-backs add width to the midfield, pushing two wingers forward and wide. Patrick Kluivert is the proven striker, playing just ahead of Ronald de Boer and Jari Litmanen, the twin midfield pivots.</p>
<p>Strengths: Technique and concentration, drummed in from an early age at the famed Ajax Academy. Movement, flexibility and intelligence. Ajax players are taught to know what their team-mates' responsibilities are, so they can think one-step ahead of the opposition. Keeping the ball moving.</p>
<p>Weaknesses: Confidence is low, the injury list long and heads uncharacteristically bowed. The technique is there but form has deserted even stalwarts like the De Boer brothers. The almost arrogant passing game has broken down and some players are showing poor basic ball control. Youngsters have been drafted in to replace those injured and are clearly out of their depth. Brazilian World Cup-winning defender Santos has been dropped, blamed for cramping Ajax's build-up play and disrupting the rhythm. Litmanen's absence is crucial in the middle and Babangida's supply into the penalty area is erratic.</p>
<p>Motivation: Bitter rivalry between the two clubs makes this the one game that Ajax hate to lose, even more so because Feyenoord already have a nine-point advantage in the league.</p>
<p>Line-up (from): Edwin van der Sar; John Veldman, Frank de Boer, Mario Melchiot, Winston Bogarde; Nordin Wooter, Ronald de Boer, Tijani Babangida, Marc Overmars, Martijn Reuser, Arnold Scholten; Patrick Kluivert, Dani.</p>
