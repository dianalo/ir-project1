<p>Australians were bracing</p>
<p>themselves on Friday for their biggest sporting weekend of the</p>
<p>year featuring the annual rugby league and Australian Rules</p>
<p>football grand finals, events which have triggered virtual</p>
<p>sporting civil wars.</p>
<p>The action kicks off in Melbourne on Saturday with the</p>
<p>Aussie Rules grand final between North Melbourne and the Sydney</p>
<p>Swans.</p>
<p>North Melbourne represent the 100-year-old, uniquely</p>
<p>Australian game's heartland in the southern state of Victoria,</p>
<p>while the Swans are 15-year-old newcomers and the only team from</p>
<p>Victoria's neighbours New South Wales.</p>
<p>Sunday sees the final match of a tumultuous year for the</p>
<p>Australian Rugby League, with ageing heavyweights St George</p>
<p>pitted against the heavily-favoured but widely disliked Manly.</p>
<p>St George, a traditional powerhouse in the 88-year history</p>
<p>of the Australian Rugby League (ARL), reached the grand final</p>
<p>after being rated 100-1 outsiders at the start of the season.</p>
<p>The old working-class club from Sydney's southern suburbs,</p>
<p>is in the Guinness Book of World Records for its 11 consecutive</p>
<p>titles in the 1950s and 60s, the only team to have achieved the</p>
<p>feat in any football code.</p>
<p>But St George was almost forced to merge with another inner</p>
<p>city club early this year because of financial problems.</p>
<p>It then lost two coaches and several key players in the</p>
<p>fallout of the bitter battle for control of the game between the</p>
<p>ARL and media tycoon Rupert Murdoch's banned rebel Super League.</p>
<p>Manly, a rich club from Sydney's exclusive northern beaches,</p>
<p>is the team much of Sydney loves to hate.</p>
<p>Manly's number one fan, author Tom Keneally, reportedly told</p>
<p>incoming New South Wales state police commissioner, Englishman</p>
<p>Peter Ryan, that he should support Manly in order to assimilate</p>
<p>into Sydney culture.</p>
<p>Others warned Ryan his job trying to clean up corruption in</p>
<p>the state force would be even more difficult with the massive</p>
<p>plunge in popularity support of Manly would bring.</p>
<p>Politicians have been quick to jump on the sporting</p>
<p>bandwagon, with the state premiers of New South Wales and</p>
<p>Victoria indulging in a week of sniping over the match.</p>
<p>Victorians have accused their northern neighbours of trying</p>
<p>to usurp their game while Sydney supporters say Victorians are</p>
<p>using dirty tricks to avoid being beaten at their own game.</p>
<p>Australia Prime Minister John Howard, whose electorate is in</p>
<p>Sydney, on Friday came out in support of St George and the</p>
<p>Sydney Swans, who both wear red and white playing strips.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm going for a red and white double...St George by four or</p>
<p>five, Sydney by 10,&quot; Howard told business leaders at a lunch in</p>
<p>Melbourne.</p>
