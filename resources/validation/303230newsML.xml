<p>Polish Foreign Minister Dariusz Rosati said on Monday that Russia had nothing to fear from the enlargement of NATO and that some Russians were victims of their own propaganda against the organisation.</p>
<p>&quot;NATO enlargement is not aimed against any country,&quot; Rosati told a news conference during a trip to Lisbon.</p>
<p>&quot;We look at NATO enlargement as an enlargement of an area of stability in Europe. This area of stability which has proven its efficiency in more than 40 years of NATO's existence could and should be extended to cover other countries,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Earlier Rosati discussed Poland's application to join NATO and the European Union with Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama. Portugal backs Poland's bid to join both organisations.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that Russia's fears connected with NATO enlargement are a product of some false stereotypes which had been rooted deeply in Russian mentality,&quot; Rosati said.</p>
<p>&quot;Sometimes the Russians are victims of their own propaganda against NATO. NATO is not an aggressive bloc. NATO is an alliance of democratic countries and as such is not a threat to anyone,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Rosati said Poland would probably have joined NATO in the late 1940s had not the then Stalinist Soviet Union and Western states signed the Yalta agreement which prevented central European countries from joining European-Atlantic institutions.</p>
<p>&quot;(Poland's membership of NATO) is just a very natural step,&quot; Rosati said.</p>
<p>&quot;We, Poland, are prepared to cooperate very closely with Russia and to maintain a dialogue with the Russians in order to discuss all security problems which the Russians may have in the context of NATO enlargement,&quot; he added.</p>
