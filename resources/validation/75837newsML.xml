<p>NATO countries agreed on Wednesday they would probably have to keep thousands of troops in Bosnia next year after the current peace mission mandate runs out on December 20.</p>
<p>It was the first public acknowledgement by the alliance that such a force may be necessary.</p>
<p>Officials said they had agreed to order the military to draw up a number of options for a possible follow-on to the current NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR), Europe's biggest military deployment since World War Two.</p>
<p>No binding decisions were taken at an informal meeting of defence ministers in the Norwegian port city of Bergen.</p>
<p>&quot;We see the basis of a consensus for a new mission emerging,&quot;  German Defence Minister Volker Ruehe told reporters. He said any new mission would involve &quot;deterrence and stabilisation&quot;.</p>
<p>Later, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana cautioned that no decision had yet been taken on whether to send a follow-on force. But no countries had come out against the idea.</p>
<p>He told reporters the alliance's 16 defence ministers had agreed to ask the military authorities to start contingency planning for &quot;whatever is necessary in a post-IFOR operation&quot;.</p>
<p>Solana said: &quot;This does not imply there will be a post-IFOR. It means that we want to start contingency planning in case a post-IFOR is needed.&quot;</p>
<p>Officials said all alliance nations broadly accepted some sort of force would probably be necessary to stop the country slipping back into war, but stressed it could only do so if a number of serious conditions were fixed.</p>
<p>Primary among these would be clear, specific tasks set for the mission.</p>
<p>&quot;Nobody said we did not need a Bosnia force...it is an option which can no longer be kept in the background,&quot; said one NATO official.</p>
<p>&quot;There was an overwhelming consensus that although we have achieved a lot, we have not achieved enough to say that peace has been achieved,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Alliance diplomats said the ministers wanted the military to begin a study of the tasks any force would be required to undertake and the risks it would face.</p>
<p>&quot;We must decide on force aims before we can even discuss its size,&quot; a senior alliance diplomat told Reuters.</p>
<p>NATO sources said that although U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry did not explicitly say U.S. troops would be in the force there was broad agreement it would include the same countries as IFOR.</p>
<p>The U.S. currently has some 15,000 troops serving in the 52,000-strong IFOR force, sent in last December to police the Dayton peace accords. Britain and France, the other main contributors, will not remain without a U.S. ground presence.</p>
<p>The issue is highly sensitive in the United States ahead of November's presidential elections. President Bill Clinton originally said the troops would be home by the end of the year.</p>
<p>NATO officials said the military would be instructed at the next meeting of the alliance's policy-making North Atlantic Council to start work on four options for 1997.</p>
<p>These would involve:</p>
<p>-- total withdrawal of existing force in line with the current political instructions</p>
<p>-- a deterrence force limited to preventing an outbreak of fresh fighting</p>
<p>-- a deterrence force with a wider mandate to provide a general security framework in which emerging civilian structures can begin to function</p>
<p>-- a force fulfilling deterrence and giving much wider support to civilian reconstruction efforts, including freedom of movement for refugees and returnees</p>
<p>&quot;There was a general consensus that the force has to have the freedom to do its job,&quot; said the official, adding ministers all insisted on a need to have continued Russian involvement in the follow-on force.</p>
