<p>An organiser of the Miss World show said on Saturday leaders of a militant Indian womens' group threatening to wreck the show by staging human torch suicide protests had spurned her offer of talks.</p>
<p>&quot;We've offered our hand to these people to come and see what Miss World is all about. But their blind prejudice is very difficult to overcome,&quot; Julia Morley, president of the Miss World Organisation, told Reuters in Bangalore.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not interested in holding talks with them. Let the organisers first stop the show,&quot; Kinay Narayan Shishikala, firebrand leader of the Mahila Jagran Samiti said.</p>
<p>Protesters say the beauty pageant demeans women and is an invasion of Indian culture.</p>
<p>A 25-year-old man set himself on fire as a protest on Thursday in Madurai, some 432 kilometres (270 miles) away from Bangalore, the southern city hosting Miss World.</p>
<p>The death sent shudders through organisers of Miss World, a show that has become an annual fixture of television programmers worldwide, and raised fears of more protests.</p>
<p>The 88 Miss World contestants went through rehearsals on Saturday. Their next public outing will be on Sunday for the Miss Photogenic phase of the contest, to be held in the outskirts of India's &quot;Garden City&quot;.</p>
<p>Around two billion television viewers in 115 countries are expected to watch Miss World being crowned on November 23.</p>
<p>Security forces will be closely watching the 20,000 people inside the Chinnaswamy cricket stadium on the final night.</p>
<p>Members of the Mahila Jagran Samiti have threatened to infiltrate the crowd, take cyanide pills to lessen the pain and set light to their silk saris to die in flames.</p>
<p>Because of cultural differences alarm is greater among non-Indians about the lengths that &quot;fanatics&quot; will go to grab attention, Julia Morley said. &quot;For me it is horrific. But local people just shrug their shoulders,&quot; Julia Morley said.</p>
<p>She was saddened and angered by the suicide in Madurai, but said Miss World was not going to fold up and leave.</p>
<p>And the Mahila Jagran Smaiti is holding its threat in abeyance, while waiting for a court ruling on its petition to ban the show. &quot;We will decide on a course of action after the judgement,&quot; Shishikala said.</p>
<p>A judge is expected to make his decision on Monday, and if he turns down the petition, the Karanataka state government in Bangalore will be free to call in around 2,000 paramilitary officers to help safeguard the event.</p>
<p>All previous attempts to block the pageant through the courts have failed.</p>
<p>Pramila Nesargi, a legislator for the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) who has moved four petitions in court, also saw little point in talking with organisers.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't see any purpose in having a meeting with them. We believe strongly that such shows are an assault on our culture. It is still not too late for them to call it off,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Julia Morley said politicians and extremist groups were trying to sensationalise the event for their own ends. Local people in Bangalore have welcomed Miss World and are upset by the bad publicity generated by a minority, she said.</p>
<p>Vidhisha Pavate, a top model who now graces Paris catwalks, said: &quot;The arguments are silly. We faced the British invasion and the Moghul rule. One pageant lasting two hours cannot affect our culture.&quot;</p>
