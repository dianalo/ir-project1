<p>German trade unions and employers on Monday prepared for an emergency meeting on sick pay after attempts last week by major firms to implement a controversial law cutting benefits were met by mass protests.</p>
<p>Employer representatives denied weekend news reports that the meeting had been requested by German industrial giant Daimler-Benz AG, which was the first large company to introduce the cuts and has already been hit by wildcat strikes.</p>
<p>Dieter Hundt, vice-president of the Gesamtmetall association of metal and electronics employers, said employers had &quot;for weeks&quot; been inviting the IG Metall trade union to discuss a new law seeking to trim sick pay costs by 20 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The metal and electronics industry does not need a hot autumn but cool heads,&quot; Hundt told German radio on Monday, referring to the &quot;hot autumn&quot; of industrial unrest that many union leaders have been threatening.</p>
<p>IG Metall vice-chairman Walter Riester said at the weekend that Germany would see &quot;tougher strikes than the country has ever experienced&quot; if no agreement could be reached on the matter.</p>
<p>The talks were due to start at 1300 GMT in a hotel just outside Frankfurt, with a statement from the two sides expected two hours later at around 1500 GMT.</p>
<p>Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Monday repeated calls for the two sides to debate the issue sensibly and criticised them for not having attempted to reach a consensus earlier.</p>
<p>Employers and unions were seen as initially seeking to defuse tension on the issue, particularly with IG Metall due to announce its overall 1997 wage demands for the 3.5 million workers it represents on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Further protests were also being planned at Daimler for Thursday to follow the stoppages involving around 100,000 Daimler employees last Tuesday that were estimated to have cost Daimler's Mercedes luxury car unit alone 80 million marks ($52.26 million).</p>
<p>One possible compromise between employers and workers was seen as replacing the envisaged 20 percent cut in sick pay benefits with a corresponding reduction in holiday.</p>
<p>An employee would thus continue to get 100 percent of salary while ill but would lose one day of holiday for each five days sick.</p>
<p>A similar system has already been put into practice at carmaker Audi AG, a unit of Volkswagen AG, where workers will accrue &quot;time debts&quot; either to be worked off or paid back.</p>
