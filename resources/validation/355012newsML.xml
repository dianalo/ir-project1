<title>UK: Demutualisation of life insurers will continue - S&amp;P.</title>
<headline>Demutualisation of life insurers will continue - S&amp;P.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-02-04</dateline>

<p>Insurance ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's predicted on Tuesday that the trend towards demutualsation in the life industry would continue, but warned it did not necessarily offer the best deal for policyholders.</p>
<p>Speaking at a press conference in London, S&amp;P's life insurance expert Martin Lees said the reasons for demutualisation were seen as either defensive or offensive.</p>
<p>Offensive reasons included the need for more capital to allow aggressive action in the market, capital which would otherwise have to be raised using debt.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not that capital is king, but financial flexibility is fundamental,&quot; said Lees.</p>
<p>&quot;Demutualisation could be good news for 'with profits' funds in times when solvency is under pressure,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It also frees cash for investment in information technology, and more importantly creates the ability to access further amounts of capacity whenever need, whether the company is floated or bought,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>However Lees stressed that this was only true if a parent company was strong and committed to the acquired company's market.</p>
<p>&quot;Companies such as Aegon or Halifax would be able to offer this, but a company such as Gan has too many well-publicised problems of its own to be a reliable source of future investment,&quot; Lees said.  </p>
<p>Lees pointed out that any price for a mutual should be set against the background of UK life insurance sales.</p>
<p>&quot;Shareholders want higher returns precisely at a time when profit margins are being eroded. Sales plummeted in 1994-95, and although income is now getting back to 1993 levels, S&amp;P believes planned profit margins are lower than they were in the mid 1980s,&quot; said Lees.</p>
<p>Such an environment may attract policyholders to a buyer offering a guaranteed cash windfall. Although this has never happened in the life industry, a cash goodwill element was included in last weeks 1.4 billion stg offer from Abbey National to buy Scottish Amicable.</p>
<p>However Lees made a plea for a longer term view.</p>
<p>&quot;If a company is in a healthy position and well run, and can still achieve good profits,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Demutualisation is like taking steroids. It can be very valuable for someone in poor health, but it can have side effects. Avoid taking them unless it is absolutely necessary,&quot; he said.</p>
