<p>Tens of thousands of Nepalis on Friday gathered to celebrate King Birendra's 25th year on the throne in the world's only Hindu kingdom.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba gave an address in honour of the 52-year-old king whose role was reduced to that of a constitutional monarch in 1990 after a popular pro-democracy movement.</p>
<p>About 45 people were killed during that campaign before the king agreed to a parliamentary system in Nepal.</p>
<p>Two military helicopters showered flower petals on the national stadium where Nepalis from all walks of life had arrived to greet the king.</p>
<p>Different communities of the mountainous kingdom presented their cultural tableaux on the occasion which capped the year- long celebrations to honour the king, considered by the Hindus as the incarnation of Lord Vishnu, the protector of human kind.</p>
<p>After his accession to the throne in 1972, King Birendra ruled the Himalayan kingdom, one of the world's 10 poorest countries, as an absolute monarch until 1990 when he lifted a ban on political parties imposed by his father in 1960.</p>
<p>&quot;Seven years ago we promulgated the constitution... reinstating a parliamentary system of governement in the country in accordance with the wishes of our people,&quot; the king said in his first public speech since 1990.</p>
<p>Under the constitution prepared in 1990, King Birendra has ceded all powers except that as constitutional monarch. He has abstained from politics which has made him popular among the people.</p>
