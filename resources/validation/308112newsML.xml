<p>Scientific research being carried out in civilian, rather than military, laboratories could provide the knowledge to develop a new generation of nuclear bombs, a British defence magazine said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>These weapons may not be subject to treaties covering existing nuclear weapons, according to Jane's International Defense Review.</p>
<p>It quoted Andre Gsponer of the Independent Scientific Research Institute in Geneva as saying the weapons will be based on new research into astro-physics, nuclear physics and the physics of the elementary particles that make up matter.</p>
<p>Compared with present-day nuclear arsenals, tomorrow's weapons will offer big military advantages, especially when used tactically, as most will produce no sigificant radioactivity.</p>
<p>&quot;They will also have political advantages since only the U.S, given its technology base, will be able to develop them,&quot; the magazine said.</p>
<p>It said the first type of new nuclear bombs to emerge would probably be nuclear fusion weapons.</p>
<p>Nuclear fusion is the process which gives the sun its energy and extremely high temperatures and pressures are needed to produce it.</p>
<p>Scientists have already achieved some nuclear fusion using currently available high explosives but the amount of fusion produced has not been nearly enough to be militarily useful.</p>
<p>This problem could be solved by new explosives currently being developed which can produce energy concentrations much greater than those produced by today's explosives.</p>
<p>The magazine said fusion weapons are likely to have explosive yields equivalent to those of up to 1,000 tonnes of TNT high explosive.</p>
<p>Nuclear fusion weapons could be triggered by lasers, which themselves would produce small thermonuclear explosions.</p>
<p>&quot;U.S. nuclear scientists will study these mini thermonuclear explosions as a substitute for nuclear weapons tests,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Research at the National Ignition Facility at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in California is also being carried out into metallic hydrogen.</p>
<p>Above a certain pressure, hydrogen can be converted into a solid metallic state 30 times more explosive than conventional high explosive. This could be used in the triggers of fusion nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>The same function could be performed by nuclear isomers -- materials with highly excited nuclear states which can store huge amounts of energy -- also being researched at Lawrence Livermore.</p>
