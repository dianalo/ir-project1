<p>Bosnian citizens won the right to exchange local dinars for hard currency for the first time this week, Bosnia's National Bank vice-governor said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The decision is effective for all 40 business banks in the Moslem-Croat federation from December 5,&quot; vice-governor Obrad Piljak told Reuters.</p>
<p>Piljak said there were no limits on currency purchases but some banks put a daily ceiling on transactions of 1,000 German marks, the only foreign currency available.</p>
<p>&quot;This will help restore citizens' confidence in their banks and help them solve their problems at bank counters and not on the black market,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The official exchange rate is 100 dinars for one German Mark. It was set in 1994 and was linked to a rigorous monetary policy of only issuing dinars covered by mark reserves, Piljak said.</p>
<p>The last time Bosnians were able to purchase hard currency was in 1990 when Bosnia, then one of Yugoslavia's republics, was experiencing a brief economic revival under prime minister Ante Markovic, who made the Yugoslav currency convertible.</p>
<p>Fighting broke out in 1991 in Slovenia and Croatia as Yugoslavia's break-up began. Hard currency savings were frozen and customers were unable to withdraw or purchase any foreign funds.</p>
<p>Bosnia-Hercegovina is made up of the Moslem-Croat federation, which rules 51 percent of the territory and a Serb republic in the remaining 49 percent.</p>
<p>The two parts were supposed to be united under the 1995 peace accord and to have one central bank and a single currency. But progress on joint institutions has remained slow and the Serb republic uses Yugoslav dinars as their local money.</p>
<p>German marks remain the common currency among the divided communities.</p>
<p>Before conversion was allowed people used the black market to buy hard currency at 110 or 120 dinars to the mark.</p>
<p>The national bank's decision is meant to draw bank customers away from the black market and stabilise the value of the dinar.</p>
<p>The banks charge two percent commission for the purchase, selling one DEM for 102 dinars.</p>
