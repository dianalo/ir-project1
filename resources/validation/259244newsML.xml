<p>Delhi shares closed higher in hectic trade on Monday buoyed by Finance Minister P. Chidambaram's statement that a controversial tax on companies might be removed, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Delhi Stock Exchange's sensitive index closed 14.95 points, or 2.3 percent, higher at 661.75.  </p>
<p>Chidambaram was quoted on Sunday as saying there might be reason for the minimum alternate tax (MAT) to &quot;disappear&quot; as both company law and the income tax act were being redrafted.</p>
<p>Industry has complained that the MAT has eroded some companies' profits.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems that the government is considering overall measures to bring back buoyancy in the capital market and may announce measures to woo investors,&quot; said Anil Saigal of brokers A.K. Saigal.</p>
<p>ACC was in spotlight throughout the day and closed 85 rupees, or 8.4 percent, higher at 1,095 on heavy buying by foreign institutional investors (FIIs), brokers said.</p>
<p>Reliance Industries gained 5.10 rupees to 193.35 on mutual fund buying.</p>
<p>State Bank of India ended 8.90 rupees, or 4.3 percent, higher at 217.50 on heavy buying by FIIs coupled with short-covering by speculators.</p>
<p>TELCO surged 22.50 rupees to 335 on speculative buying.</p>
<p>Larsen and Toubro jumped 5.20 rupees to 212.45.</p>
