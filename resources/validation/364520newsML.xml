<p>The Oslo bourse powered to a new all-time high in hetic trade on Friday as buyers flocked to pick up Norwegian stocks, dealers said.</p>
<p>An already positive market was given a further boost late in the session by favourable U.S. job data, they said.</p>
<p>Oslo's Total index advanced more than one percent end the week at 1,082.13 points, just off the intra-day peak at 1,082.40 points, in turnover of 1.4 billion crowns.</p>
<p>&quot;There are a lot of buyers in the market, the liquidity is very good and that's helping to drive things. But we were really boosted near the end by the U.S. figures,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>&quot;Domestic investors are buying, but its foreigners who want to have a stake in Norway.&quot;</p>
<p>Engineering and construction giant Kvaerner jumped 5.16 percent in the A stock to close at 328 crowns in trade worth 81.4 million.</p>
<p>Dealers said Kvaerner was on investors' shopping lists because it recently had announced contracts amounting to more than 20 billion crowns. It also had been lagging, they said.</p>
<p>Trade was a hefty 81.5 million crowns in telecommunications group Nera, which climbed five crowns to 315 crowns. Dealers said the share was repricing after losing ground on slightly disappointing 1996 results released on Tuesday.</p>
