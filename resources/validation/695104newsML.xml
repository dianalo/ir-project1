<p>Italy's largest insurance company Generali said at the weekend it had raised its stake in Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI) to nearly five percent but denied it wanted to influence the direction of the bank.</p>
<p>Generali executives told the annual shareholders' meeting here on Saturday the Trieste-based insurer now had a total stake in BCI of 4.95 percent, which was worth some 345 billion lire ($203 million) at current market value.</p>
<p>The additional one percent, bought from Austria's Creditanstalt, confirms the insurer as BCI's biggest single shareholder beyond France's Paribas and Germany's Commerzbank.</p>
<p>&quot;But it doesn't mean that we want to influence the management of the bank, we are insurers and want to sell our products through the bank network,&quot; Generali's chairman Antoine Bernheim told reporters at a news conference after the meeting.</p>
<p>The purchase, made about 20 days ago at a price close to BCI's share price on the Milan stock exchange of 3,600 lire, aims to enhance cooperation between Generali and BCI in bank insurance products and in operations abroad.</p>
<p>Managing director Gianfranco Gutty said the insurer had wanted to increase its BCI stake after buying one percent back in February &quot;so we caught this chance to buy again (from Creditanstalt) without pushing up the market price.&quot;</p>
<p>Gutty, who was named BCI vice chairman earlier this year, said the decision to take a bigger holding in BCI would have &quot;important consequences&quot; for Generali's own operations.</p>
<p>Generali already markets life insurance and pension policies in coordination with BCI units, especially in South America.</p>
<p>The Italian bank, which was privatised in 1994, has a statutory ceiling of three percent on the voting weight of a shareholder, meaning Generali's stake of nearly five percent will only carry three percent in voting rights.</p>
<p>The bank is considering revising its statutes, however, which could result in revision or abolition of the ceiling.</p>
<p>Generali is also looking to increase its presence in France where its market share is currently 3.5 percent. Bernheim called this level &quot;insufficient&quot; and said Generali was talking with different groups about a possible acquisition.</p>
<p>&quot;We are examining different opportunities with some groups, local press spoke about (French insurer) Athena, but up to now there's nothing certain, only talks,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The group's written premiums in Italy rose 10 percent in the first four months of 1997 with life insurance premiums up 13 percent and non-life premiums up eight percent.</p>
<p>Non-life premiums rose eight percent over the same period, of which car insurance climbed six percent and non-car business 10 percent. Generali said it expected a six to eight percent increase in non-life premiums for the whole of 1997.</p>
<p>Investment income totalled 352 billion lire in January-April, up 12 percent on the same period in 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;The first 1997 figures show a clear improvement,&quot; Gutty said but added Generali wanted to expand its business to 40.0 trillion lire in consolidated premiums and have profit growth of 10 percent this year.</p>
<p>Premiums totalled 34.92 trillion in 1996, up 10 percent on 1995, while the net profit was 1.44 trillion lire.</p>
