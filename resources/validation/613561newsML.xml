<title>POLAND: Polish shares fall on Handlowy offer, seen flat.</title>

<p>The Warsaw bourse fell 1.7 percent in thin trade on Monday with investor interest and funds focused on Bank Handlowy SA public offer worth up to billion zlotys but analysts saw stabilisation later this week.</p>
<p>The main market's WIG index fell 1.7 percent, to 15,899.6, and turnover fell 6.6 percent to 131 million zlotys ($40.9 million) on all three markets as 83 issues fell, eight rose and 10 were flat.</p>
<p>Analysts did not expect steep falls, saying that any drops were likely to spur institutional buying as Polish stocks already were starting to look attractive at current prices.</p>
<p>&quot;The low investor activity on the secondary market is because funds are being tied up in Handlowy...in the near term the stagnation might be maintained,&quot; said Artur Czerwonski, an analyst at Pekao SA brokerage.</p>
<p>Some analysts said another fall was possible on Tuesday, but said the market was likely to stabilise later.</p>
<p>Analysts said Poland's largest commercial Bank Handlowy offer, which started on Monday, was likely to draw capital from the exchange and could also hurt listed banks.</p>
<p>But they said in the longer-term the addition of Handlowy to the bourse's menu would make it more attractive and would help attract new investments.</p>
<p>Analysts said another huge offer of copper giant KGHM, expected next month and parliamentary elections due in September would also likely dampen buying in coming weeks.</p>
<p>Some said the fallout of the Czech currency crisis which hit the zloty could make some investors nervous about Polish currency risk even though fundamentals looked solid.</p>
<p>But they said Poland's good macroeconomic environment, such as falling inflation expected at below 13 percent in the end of the year, would prevent steep falls.</p>
