<p>Croatian experts working under international supervision, exhumed at least 57 bodies from a mass grave in the Eastern Slavonia region thought to be those of Croats killed by Serb forces in 1991, officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>Investigators found the remains of &quot;at least 57 civilians&quot; in a mass grave near the village of Lovas, Colonel Ivan Grujic, chief of the Croatian government commission for missing persons, told reporters at U.N. headquarters in Vukovar.</p>
<p>Vukovar, on the Danube River border with Serbia and main town of Eastern Slavonia, was demolished in a ferocious three-month siege by the Yugoslav army backing a local Serb minority revolt against Croatia's secession from Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>Croatian investigators, working under forensic experts from the International Criminal Tribunal on former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague, found bodies buried from 50 cm (1.5 feet) to 160 cm (5 feet) deep.</p>
<p>Grujic said evidence obtained from the Lovas municipal authorities suggested that 68 people killed between October 10 and 18, 1991, were dumped into the pit.</p>
<p>The victims met a violent death and all, bar &quot;one or two Serbs&quot;, were elderly Croat civilians, equally men and women, he said. Grujic declined to be drawn on the cause of death except to say &quot;some were shot&quot;.</p>
<p>He said wrist watches and other personal belongings were found beside some of the bodies, while numerous victims had white scarves tied around their sleeves.</p>
<p>Grujic expected the excavation of the grave to be completed within two days and the bodies will then be taken to Zagreb, the Croatian capital, for identification.</p>
<p>Lovas, a hamlet some 20 km (12 miles) southeast of the infamous Ovcara mass grave near Vukovar, was taken by Serb paramilitary forces on October 10, 1991.</p>
<p>ICTY has indicted three former Yugoslav army officers for the killing of 261 Croat hospital patients seized in Vukovar after the town's fall to Serb forces in November 1991. But Yugoslav authorities have refused to extradite the three.</p>
<p>Last October, ICTY experts retrieved 200 bodies from Ovcara, where the patients were said by survivors and other witnesses to have been machine-gunned.</p>
<p>The massacre at Ovcara was among the most notorious in the six-month war in 1991, but other mass graves are believed to lurk in Eastern Slavonia. The Lovas grave was the 63rd to be dug up in Croatia as a whole, Grujic said.</p>
<p>Eastern Slavonia is now under transitional United Nations administration but is due to be handed back to Croatian government control on July 15.</p>
<p>Croatia recaptured all other Serb-held territory in a lightning offensive in 1995 and Eastern Slavonia is now home to thousands of Serbs who fled their advance.</p>
<p>Each side has accused the other of committing war atrocities. The war crimes tribunal in The Hague has indicted 75 people but mostly in connection with atrocities in neighbouring Bosnia.</p>
