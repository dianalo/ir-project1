<title>RUSSIA: Yeltsin returns to Moscow after summit.</title>

<dateline>MOSCOW 1997-06-23</dateline>

<p>President Boris Yeltsin returned to Moscow on Monday after attending a summit of the Group of Seven main industrialised nations in the U.S. city of Denver, the Kremlin said.</p>
<p>&quot;The president has arrived at (the government) Vnukovo-2 airport,&quot; a spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Yeltsin hailed the summit as a success for Russia, which won admission to the Paris Club of creditor nations and gained the backing of G7 leaders for its bid to join other global economic organisations.</p>
<p>But he also triggered fresh concern about his health on Saturday when he missed a late-night gala concert. He resurfaced on Sunday looking well and refreshed and aides said he had just been tired after a heavy schedule of talks.</p>
<p>Asked about his health on Monday, the Kremlin spokeswoman said the president was probably tired after his long flight but otherwise fine.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, who has a history of mysterious disappearing acts, had open heart surgery last November.</p>
<p>The G7 includes the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada. Russia is not a formal member but Russian officials say the gathering has effectively become the G8 as Yeltsin attended all but one of the summit events.</p>
