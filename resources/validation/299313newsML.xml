<headline>Strong jobs data pushes dlr broadly higher in U.S..</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-01-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>The dollar rallied against European currencies on news of surprisingly strong domestic job growth and reversed overnight losses against the yen.</p>
<p>The Labor Department disclosed U.S. nonfarm payrolls rose by 262,000 in December, far exceeding consensus forecasts. That show of strength encouraged investors to push the dollar to a 29-month high against the German mark and a 31-month high against the Swiss franc.</p>
<p>The dollar rose to 1.5856/61 marks, its highest close since August 1994 and up from 1.5765/75 at the open. The dollar climbed to 1.3755/65 Swiss francs from 1.3712/22.  </p>
<p>The dollar also rose to 116.10/15 yen from 115.45/50 at the open, but failed to top Thursday's close at 116.35/40.</p>
<p>Dealers initially hesitated to buy dollars when stocks and bonds fell after the employment report at 0830 EST/1330 GMT.</p>
<p>Investors worried signs of a robust American economy could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates, which would likely weaken stocks and bonds.</p>
<p>But while the benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury bond ended down 1-8/32 point, lifting its yield to levels not seen since last September, the Dow Jones industrials rebounded from early lows to finish at a record high, boosting the dollar.  </p>
<p>&quot;There was talk early in the day of U.S. interest rates going up and the crash in Treasuries hurt the dollar. But as stocks made a strong recovery, the dollar came back up,&quot; said David Ogg, foreign exchange manager at Dresdner Bank.</p>
<p>In Tokyo trading the dollar began lower as the Nikkei 225 stock index sank over four percent.</p>
<p>Sharp declines in Tokyo stock prices had helped boost the dollar earlier in the week, but the latest drop had investors speculating that Japan's banks would be forced to sell foreign assets, and dollars, to meet capital requirements back home.  </p>
<p>&quot;Some heavy fund selling helped push the dollar down against the yen on the back of talk of capital repatriation by the Japanese,&quot; Ogg said.</p>
<p>But that selling appeared to come mostly from non-Japanese entities and experts at Japanese firms said the concerns were exaggerated.</p>
<p>&quot;American investment banks and other foreign bank dealers are thinking the Japanese should sell their foreign assets. But actually, the Japanese investors have not been doing that recently,&quot; said Tadatoshi Taso, chief foreign exchange dealer at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.  </p>
<p>The British pound fell sharply to $1.6798/03 from $1.6848/58.</p>
<p>Dealers cited a report showing Britain's manufacturing sector shrank 0.5 percent in November for sterling selling.</p>
<p>In other trade, the dollar fell to Canadian $1.3485/90 from C$1.3520/25. The Australian dollar rose to $0.7818/25 from $0.7775/80 at the open.</p>
