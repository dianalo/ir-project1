<p>The threat of inflation may not be visible now but U.S. bonds will be hard-pushed to extend a staggering rally beyond the 6.50 percent yield barrier, economists said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The 30-year bond, yielding 6.56 percent against more than 7.0 in April, is faced with the daunting challenge of piercing 6.50 and heading for levels not seen since November 1996.</p>
<p>Few economists think it will.</p>
<p>&quot;It's the kind of level that many investors set as the target so we're going to see more and more profit taking the closer we get to that,&quot; said Stephen Lewis, chief economist at London Bond Broking Company.</p>
<p>&quot;In the absence of some special piece of news, which doesn't want to be on the horizon at the moment, I think we're going to stall around here,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Against this background, analysts also say European debt may finally regain some ground against the U.S., which has outperformed Bunds in recent months.</p>
<p>Soft data have fuelled a meteoric rally, with September futures surfacing above 114-00 this week, up nearly six full points since late May. By 1230 GMT, they stood 7/32 lower on the day at 113-22.</p>
<p>Economists think the honeymoon over the U.S. economy will soon end and demand-led forces could pose problems.</p>
<p>Treasuries look overpriced, particularly at the short end, they say, and the market is counting on interest rate scenarios that are too optimistic.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm marginally friendly but I would preface that with the very significant caveat that the market is rather expensive at these levels,&quot; said Michael Derks, fixed income strategist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve, so far in no hurry to pull the trigger on rates, may not be able to resist taking pre-emptive action in the autumn.</p>
<p>&quot;The market which is focusing almost exclusively on the wage component of costs may be overlooking what's going on on the margin side. We may be seeing a bit of demand-pull inflation rather than cost-pull,&quot; said Lewis.</p>
<p>Investors' focus will next week sharpen on June consumer prices and industrial production.</p>
<p>According to Adam Chester, international bond strategist at Yamaichi International Europe, the long bond yield can retrace back to 6.75 percent on a strong set of figures. Any mild data, although unlikely, would help it slide through 6.50 to hit 6.35 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;We are sceptical. The data could surprise on the downside and the market could be in for a bit of a correction,&quot; Chester said, adding the short end would be hit hardest.</p>
<p>Economists will also seek clues from Fed chairman Alan Greenspan's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony on July 22.</p>
<p>A report in BusinessWeek this week quoted Greenspan as saying the U.S. economy was going through a dramatic change in productivity. But that optimism might not be repeated in Humphrey-Hawkins, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;My view is that he will be as non-committal as ever and that may disappoint the market in its current frame of mind,&quot; said Lewis of London Bond Broking.</p>
<p>Economists expect the U.S. yield curve to steepen in the medium term as long bond yields rise, although further flattening can be expected near-term.</p>
<p>The U.S. was also likely to underperform Europe where a euphoria over economic and monetary union (EMU) is feeding a blistering rally in most bonds.</p>
<p>Economists said German Bunds could draw some comfort from the government's budget plans which will be unveiled on Friday. Chester said the T-note/Bund spread could pull out to 90 basis over the coming weeks from around 78 now.</p>
