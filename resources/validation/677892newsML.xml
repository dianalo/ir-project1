<title>MALAYSIA: KL interbank rates slightly lower on bill maturity.</title>
<headline>KL interbank rates slightly lower on bill maturity.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1997-06-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>Interbank rates fell slightly due to maturity of Bank Negara bills worth 500 million ringgit on Friday, dealers said.</p>
<p>A one-billion ringgit bill issue had matured on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Both the maturities were not rolled over.</p>
<p>&quot;Rates are down but not very much. Players are not pushing rates lower due to worries about the baht,&quot; said a dealer at a Malaysian bank.</p>
<p>The Thai baht remained under pressure on Friday on lingering concern about government policies after abrupt resignation of Finance Minister Amnuay Viravan.</p>
<p>One-week money was at 7.50 percent against 7.80 percent on Thursday, dealers said.</p>
<p>One- and three-month money were at 7.70/80 percent against 7.8/8.0 percent.</p>
<p>The overnight rate, which closed at 6.5/7.0 percent on Thursday, was expected to soften further to 5.8/6.5 percent, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said some local commercial banks, which were short on the overnight earlier, were getting long now.</p>
<p>But further downside was likely to be limited due to an outflow of some two billion ringgit on June 26 resulting from Bank Negara lending to the market to help ease a liquidity squeeze last month.</p>
<p>Interest rate futures on the Malaysia Monetary Exchange were marginally lower.</p>
<p>At 0330 GMT, the three-month Kuala Lumpur Interbank Offered Rate (KLIBOR) September contract was unchanged at 92.53, or an implied yield of 7.47 percent.</p>
<p>The December contract fell one point to 92.63, or 7.37 percent and March 1998 was also down one to 92.71, or 7.29 percent.</p>
