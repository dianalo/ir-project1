<title>USA: NYCE cotton ends lower, fund selling before data.</title>
<headline>NYCE cotton ends lower, fund selling before data.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-10-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>NYCE cotton futures weakened on persistent fund selling ahead of Friday's USDA supply and demand data.</p>
<p>Trade buying supported the market at the lows.</p>
<p>December ended down 0.83 cent at 75.40 cents a lb, having ranged from 76.40 and 75.16. The back months closed 0.80 to 0.40 lower.</p>
<p>Volume was estimated at 7,000 lots.</p>
<p>Market sources pegged the U.S. crop estimate between 18.2 million and 17.5 million 480-lb bales, compared with September's forecast of 17.9 million bales.</p>
<p>While players do not expect the report to move prices dramatically, the market closed weaker on several pieces of bearish news.</p>
<p>Imports for the week ended Oct 6 were only 13,437 bales, but cumulative imports reached 368,480. The USDA put imports at 500,000 for the season, an estimate that is likely to increase in Friday's USDA report, market sources said.</p>
<p>Also, the USDA's weekly export report showing new sales of at 221,000 bales for the week, included two large and probably one-time purchases to Turkey and Mexico.</p>
<p>Talk about the deteriorating quality of the U.S. crop continues to haunt the market as sluggish mill demand, illustrated by lower same-store sales data for September, also weighs on prices.</p>
<p>&quot;There is just not a lot of demand from the consumer,&quot; said Sharon Johnson, an analyst with Frank Schneider and Co Inc.</p>
