<p>Rising world crude oil prices and a plant closure for general maintenance, as expected, bit hard into Slovak refiner Slovnaft's bottom line in 1996, company officials said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Slovnaft, the country's sole crude oil refiner, said its 1996 net profit was 1.29 billion crowns, down some 30 percent from its 1995 result of 1.828 billion.</p>
<p>In presenting the results at a general shareholders meeting on Thursday, Slovnaft Director Slavomir Hatina said the figures were still positive despite the drop in profits, given average world crude oil prices were about 50 percent higher than the previous year.</p>
<p>&quot;A constant rise of the world oil prices was a reasonable problem (during 1996), and resulted in rising costs for the crude oil by more than four billion crowns, or 23 percent more than 1995,&quot; Hatina said.</p>
<p>&quot;On the other hand, we did not calculate this increase completely into the prices of our products, mainly motor fuels,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Hatina said that a planned general maintenance programme which shut down some 70 percent of the firm's refining capacity from early March until the end of April also hurt profitability.</p>
<p>Oil prices are among those still regulated by the state and any changes must be approved by the finance ministry. The government, on request from Slovnaft, hiked motor fuel prices five times in 1996, but consumers still pay well below levels found in western Europe for petrol.</p>
<p>Hatina said he also was encouraged by a 7.2 percent rise in sales against 1995, which showed the company's flexible performance on the markets, including a revival in business contacts with all the states of former Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>Slovnaft exports about 50 percent of its production and motor fuels account for about 63 percent of its overall refining capacity. It has an 80 percent share of the local petrol market.</p>
<p>Slovakia imports all its crude oil from Russia, through the Druzhba (Friendship) pipeline running via Ukraine.</p>
<p>Slovnaft said it had processed about 5.18 million tonnes of crude oil in 1996 (roughly 100,000 barrels per day), only slightly higher than the previous year but in line with forecasts.</p>
<p>Despite the fall in net profits, Slovnaft will pay a dividend of 25.5 percent of its net result, up from 18.9 percent in 1995 though the final payout is roughly equal for both years.</p>
<p>Slovnaft's main shareholders are Slovintegra a.s. with 39.00 percent, the state through the National Property Fund (NPF) at 19.15 percent, the Bank of New York, on behalf of the EBRD, with 10.53 percent, and Benzinol a.s. 5.84 percent.</p>
<p>In mid-April, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the NPF reached an agreement under which the NPF will buy back the bank's stake in Slovnaft. The transaction, however, has not yet occured.</p>
<p>The EBRD took the stake in Slovnaft in 1995 when it bought half the refiner's $113 million issue of global depositary receipts, which flopped on international markets.</p>
<p>When it bought the stake, the EBRD effectively paid the 1,000 crown face value per share. But shortly afterwards the NPF, Slovakia's privatisation agency, sold the 39 percent stake in the refiner to management-led Slovintegra at an implied price of just 156 crowns per share.</p>
