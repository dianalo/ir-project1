<p>Hong Kong stocks reversed course after 50 minutes of trade on Monday morning, to trade lower on heavy active trade, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Of the blue chips, only HSBC was really bid up this morning and when interest in it died, the index collapsed,&quot; said Janet Gillies, sales director at OCBC Securities.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index was trading 41 points down at 13,296 after one hour of trade on high turnover of HK$4.066.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong market opened on a strong note on Monday, building on the 45.00-point gain in the Hang Seng London Reference Index to 13,382.35 on Friday. The index rose to a session high of 13,445.47 before easing to trend in negative territory.</p>
<p>Banking giant HSBC Holdings was the most actively traded issue. It advanced HK$3.00 to HK$193.00 then slid back to HK$190.50.</p>
<p>The share rose HK$1.69 to HK$193.20 in London trading on Friday.</p>
<p>Hang Seng Index futures declined sharply in early trade, with the March contract falling to a low of 13210, then recovering somewhat to trade at the 13,255 level.</p>
<p>Brokers said individual investors were active and chasing red chips and H shares.</p>
<p>Red chip newcomer Shum Yip Investment was the second most actively stock. The share continued its Friday advance, adding HK$1.125 to HK$5.650 on turnover of HK$413.00 million.</p>
<p>H share newcomer China Eastern was also actively traded. The stock rose HK$0.400 to HK$2.425 on heavy trade of HK$453 million.</p>
<p>The company had said earlier on Monday through the stock exchange it knew of no reason for the share's continued rapid rise and was not conducting any discussions which would lead to asset acquisitions or disposals.</p>
<p>Cathay Pacific gained HK$0.05 to HK$12.00. The company will report 1996 earnings on Wednesday.</p>
