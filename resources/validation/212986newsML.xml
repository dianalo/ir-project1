<p>U.S. President Bill Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin met on Sunday to put a seal on new improved ties between Washington and Beijing after nearly a decade of frostiness.</p>
<p>&quot;We've had... good meetings and we'll have another one,&quot; Clinton said as he shook hands with Jiang before they began their their talks on the fringes of an Asia-Pacific trade summit. It was the fourth time the two leaders have met.</p>
<p>&quot;We first met in Seattle,&quot; Jiang noted, according to a U.S. translator. The Seattle meeting was in 1993 at the first Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit.</p>
<p>&quot;This time we're meeting right after his recent election,&quot; the Chinese leader added, with a broad smile, referring to Clinton's re-election to a second four-year term on November 5.</p>
<p>Clinton was asked by a reporter if he had any concerns about onjections by some human rights groups to the meeting because of alleged abuses by Beijing. &quot;No, we're doing the right thing,&quot; he replied.</p>
<p>The two leaders posed briefly for pictures, with the flags of their countries in the background. Both smiled as photographers and television camera crews captured the moment.</p>
<p>Before the meeting, which took place at the Central Bank of Manila and was expected to last about an hour, a senior U.S official said Clinton and Jiang would probably announce a series of high-level visits starting next year and culminating in summits in Washington and Beijing.</p>
<p>&quot;It's likely that they will discuss and maybe announce high-level visits starting with Vice President (Al) Gore,&quot; the official told Reuters.</p>
<p>Another U.S. official said: &quot;They will unfold a series of meetings in 1997 and 1998.&quot;</p>
<p>This official said the likely scenario was a visit by Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen to Washington in February or March, followed by a visit by Vice-President Al Gore to Beijing in the first half of 1997.</p>
<p>Chinese Premier Li Peng would then visit the United States, followed by a Clinton-Jiang summit in Washington in the second half of 1997 after Hong Kong is transferred to Chinese rule.</p>
<p>Clinton, who will be sworn in on January 20 for his second four-year term, would be the first U.S. president to visit the world's most populous country since George Bush in early 1989.</p>
<p>Relations between the United States and China began unravelling after the Tiananmen Square clampdown on dissidents in June of that year.</p>
<p>The Clinton-Jiang meeting, on the eve of the fourth annual APEC summit at nearby Subic Bay on Monday, capped a recent intensive effort to establish a new strategic basis for Chinese-American cooperation into the 21st Century.</p>
<p>The new approach was solidified in Beijing last week in talks between U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and senior Chinese officials, including Jiang.</p>
<p>U.S. officials said Clinton would engage Jiang on a broad range of issues, including Asian security and China's sale of nuclear technology and missiles to Iran and Pakistan.</p>
<p>Trade issues and human rights were also expected to be discussed.</p>
<p>U.S. officials said they expected no specific progress on non-proliferation and considered it unclear if the two leaders would make progress on trade issues.</p>
<p>Clinton, on his first trip abroad since his re-election and accompanied by his wife Hillary, paid a courtesy call on Philippine President Fidel Ramos before meeting Jiang and was to meet Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and South Korean President Kim Young-sam later on Sunday.</p>
<p>U.S. officials said repairing strains caused by the misconduct of U.S. military personnel on Okinawa would be high on Clinton's agenda with Hashimoto, and that he would discuss the recent North Korean submarine incursion into the South with South Korea's Kim.</p>
<p>The submarine, on an apparent infiltration mission, ran aground off South Korea's coast and that incident, as well as a bloody manhunt for occupants of the vessel, has increased tensions on the divided Korean peninsula</p>
