<p>India's decision to allow private investors into pensions and health insurance by permitting joint ventures with its two state-run monopolies is an important step towards opening the sector to foreign investment, analysts said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Finance Minister P. Chidambaram's budget for 1997/98 sent out the right signals, but did not achieve as much as expected, said foreign insurers which had hoped to get a foot in the door to India's huge insurance markets.</p>
<p>&quot;Eagle Star is encouraged by the first signs of opening up,&quot; James Robertson, country manager of U.K. insurance major Eagle Star International, told Reuters. &quot;But we're sorely disappointed they didn't go further.&quot;</p>
<p>India's Finance Ministry estimates the insurance sector, dominated by the Life Insurance Corp (LIC) and the General Insurance Corp (GIC) since it was nationalised in 1956, is growing at the rate of about 11 percent annually.</p>
<p>Provoked by growing international clamour and the need to accelerate free-market reforms launched in 1991, India has taken a number of steps to lure foreign investment in insurance, but has stopped short of letting foreigners in.</p>
<p>Before Chidambaram's fractious 15-party coalition can take any bold steps, it must reconcile its communist allies, who are bitterly opposed to any foreign presence in the sector.</p>
<p>Analysts said this had probably forced him to be cautious with further reform measures announced in the budget.</p>
<p>&quot;What I have outlined is a very modest opening of one segment of the insurance sector,&quot; Chidambaram told parliament on Friday while presenting the budget.</p>
<p>Apart from permitting a few selected Indian players into the sector, his plan visualised GIC floating joint ventures in health insurance. He emphasised that LIC and GIC would retain their monopoly status.</p>
<p>&quot;LIC will continue to enjoy a monopoly in the life insurance business and GIC will continue to enjoy a monopoly in the non-life, non-health insurance business,&quot; Chidambaram said.</p>
<p>Only Indian firms, controlled by Indians and having a majority Indian ownership, will be permitted to enter the health insurance business, Chidambaram said.</p>
<p>&quot;Any opening up is encouraging,&quot; Robertson said. &quot;We would obviously like to see, for India's sake, foreign companies being allowed to bring their knowledge to bear on these vast markets.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts' hopes that the budget would provide a blueprint for the opening up of the sector were dashed, but they welcomed the moves Chidambaram did announce.</p>
<p>&quot;Joint venture with Indian partners by LIC for pensions schemes and GIC for health schemes are welcome and indicate the phased opening-out of the insurance sector,&quot; said Freddy Daruwalla of the Bombay-based M.F. Reinsurance Services.</p>
<p>Chidambaram's move to give LIC and GIC a substantial measure of autonomy would ginger them up, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a step in the right direction to give more autonomy to LIC and GIC to free them from the shackles of bureaucratic controls and provide a level playing field to the public sector companies when the sector opens up,&quot; Daruwalla added.</p>
<p>The new moves would offer service providers an opportunity to market their expertise to the joint ventures, Vinod Sehgal, executive vice-president of Jardine Insurance Consultants, said.</p>
<p>&quot;To service providers it's good news, so on some specific subjects we will be able to make a good contribution in marketing and consulting,&quot; Sehgal told Reuters. &quot;We will be able to help them provide a high quality service.&quot;</p>
