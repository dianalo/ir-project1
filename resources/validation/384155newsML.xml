<title>UK: Dollar outweighs Chicago rise at Euro veg oil clos.</title>
<headline>Dollar outweighs Chicago rise at Euro veg oil clos.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-02-18</dateline>
<text>
<p>A firm dollar against European currency during Tuesday afternoon outweighed higher Chicago futures at the close of the vegetable oil market.</p>
<p>Despite a late dip in the dollar European sellers did not follow the firmer Chicago market.</p>
<p>&quot;They certainly know how to run a bull market in Chicago, but it's overdone and we see no reason to follow,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Palm oil closed mostly lower with no further business reported during the afternoon.</p>
<p>&quot;All the day's business took place this morning, its been a very quiet afternoon,&quot; said a trader.</p>
<p>Higher prices in Malaysia following the release of private forecaster Ivan Wong's latest report triggered some early covering on the European market. But by midday this had dried up as profit-taking in Malaysia reduced the overall gains on the day.</p>
<p>Malaysian private forecaster Ivan Wong put local output during January at 568,000 tonnes, down 11 percent from December.</p>
<p>In an earlier report Wong had projected a fall of 9.5 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Output is down because of a lack of rain in two of the main growing areas, but reading between the lines you can still see that production is going to pick up again by March,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>At the close of business crude palm oil and products were unchanged to $2.50 down.</p>
<p>Lauric oils were also lower at $2.50 to $5 down in a tradeless market.</p>
<p>Soft oils closed with soy oil unchanged to one guilder up after Mar/Apr traded at 99 guilders and May/Jul at 101 guilders a 100 kilos fob ex-mill.</p>
<p>Rape oil finished one guilder up after May/Jul traded at 101 and 101.50 guilders.</p>
<p>Traders said all of the business took place before the Chicago opening.</p>
