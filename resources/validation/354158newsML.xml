<p>The Federal Reserve began a two-day policy-making meeting Tuesday amid widespread expectations it will decide to hold interest rates steady.</p>
<p>With inflation tame and, by at least by one measure, at a 30-year low, the U.S. central bank has scant justification for raising short-term rates now, economists said.</p>
<p>&quot;They won't do anything,&quot; said Cynthia Latta, of Massachusetts-based economic consultants DRI/McGraw Hill. &quot;There are no signs out there of overheating.&quot;</p>
<p>But she and many other analysts expect the central bank to raise rates eventually to counter an anticipated buildup in inflationary pressures stemming from a tight labour market and stepped-up wage demands by workers.</p>
<p>The central bank's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee began its two-day meeting as scheduled at 2:30 p.m. (1930 GMT) on Tuesday. It was not expected to announce its rate decision until around 2:15 p.m. (1915 GMT) on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The meeting comes after news last week that the economy grew at a surprisingly robust annualized pace of 4.7 percent in the final three months of last year. But inflation remained low, with the so-called implicit price deflator rising at a 1.4 percent rate in the quarter, the slowest pace since 1967.</p>
<p>Two economic reports released Tuesday painted a picture of an economy that looks to have further room to run, but perhaps not at the rapid pace seen at the tail end of 1996.</p>
<p>The Conference Board, a New York business research group, said its index of leading indicators -- designed to predict economic conditions six to nine months ahead -- edged up 0.1 percent in December after a revised 0.2 percent November rise.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department said that new home sales eased by 1 percent in December, although sales for 1996 as a whole were their strongest in 18 years.</p>
<p>The Fed has held rates steady for over a year, since cutting them by a quarter percentage point on Jan. 31, 1996.</p>
<p>The federal funds rate that commercial banks charge each other for loans now stands at 5.25 percent. The discount rate the Fed charges on its loans to the banks is 5 percent.</p>
<p>Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan told state governors Sunday he saw no evidence of significant price pressures in the economy, Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad said.</p>
<p>&quot;He gave a positive report. We've had growth with low inflation,&quot; Branstad told reporters after the governors' closed-door meeting with the Fed chief.</p>
<p>Two pet economic indicators of Greenspan's -- the employment cost index, which measures workers' wages and benefits, and the National Association of Purchasing Managers survey -- have shown little sign of inflationary pressures.</p>
<p>In public testimony to Congress last month, Greenspan painted a picture of an economy that was surprisingly free of inflationary pressures six years into expansion.</p>
<p>He also warned of the risk that inflation could pick up as workers take advantage of the tight labour market to demand much higher wages and benefits from their employers.</p>
<p>He made clear that the Fed would not wait to act until inflation picked up, but would raise rates if it had persuasive evidence that inflationary pressures were building.</p>
<p>That is why many analysts believe a rate increase is likely, perhaps as soon as the Fed's next policy-making meeting March 25.</p>
