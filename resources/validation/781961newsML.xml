<headline>Black boxes from Korean Air crash arrive in U.S..</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-08-06</dateline>

<p>The &quot;black box&quot; flight recorders from the Korean Air Lines jet that crashed in Guam arrived on Wednesday at the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and would go directly to the agency's laboratory, an NTSB spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're going to start working on deciphering the information tonight,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Technicians hope to find some clues to the deadly crash in the electronic devices which are formally known as the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder.</p>
<p>The Boeing 747 slammed into a hillside during a torrential downpour on its approach to Guam's main international airport on a flight from Seoul, South Korea.</p>
<p>Among the 254 people aboard Korean Air Lines Flight 801, there were 30 survivors. Officials in Guam said 69 people had been confirmed dead and 155 were missing.</p>
<p>President Bill Clinton on Wednesday opened a news conference by expressing his sympathy to the families and friends of those killed.</p>
<p>&quot;Let me first say that I join with all Americans in expressing our deepest condolences to the victims of the terrible plane crash yesterday in Guam,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Clinton told reporters he had spoken to Guam's Gov. Carl Gutierrez and praised him and the hundreds of volunteers and U.S. military personnel who were working on the response and rescue effort.</p>
<p>The NTSB is leading the investigation of the crash with technical assistance from the Federal Aviation Administration and other agencies.</p>
