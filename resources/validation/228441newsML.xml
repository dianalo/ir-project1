<headline>Bahrain sets conditions for welcoming Qatari emir.</headline>

<p>Bahrain said on Monday it would welcome Qatar's Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani if he had practical ideas for settling a border dispute.</p>
<p>&quot;Bahrain welcomes receiving Qatar's emir if he carries with him a practical initiative over disputes between the two countries,&quot; Information Minister Mohammad Ibrahim al-Mutawae told Reuters.</p>
<p>Mutawae was commenting on remarks in a Kuwaiti newspaper published on Monday which quoted Sheikh Hamad as saying he was ready to visit Bahrain to persuade it not to boycott Saturday's Gulf Arab summit.</p>
<p>&quot;If my brothers in Bahrain would agree, I have no objection to go in person to Bahrain to invite (Bahrain's Emir) Sheikh Isa (bin Sulman al-Khalifa) to attend the Gulf Summit,&quot; Sheikh Hamad told the daily al-Qabas.</p>
<p>Bahrain has said it would not attend the annual summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) -- grouping Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates -- due to be held in the Qatari capital Doha on December 7.</p>
<p>Qatar and Bahrain are locked in a territorial dispute over a group of barren islands, reefs and sandbanks in the Gulf controlled by Bahrain since the 1930s but also claimed by Qatar.</p>
<p>Qatar has taken the dispute to the International Court of Justice in The Hague. The move has angered Bahrain which insists on a Gulf Arab solution. Qatar has said it would only withdraw the case if Saudi Arabia's mediation was successful.</p>
<p>Bahrain said on Monday it had arrested two Qataris on charges of spying for Qatar, a small peninsula on the east coast of Saudi Arabia.</p>
