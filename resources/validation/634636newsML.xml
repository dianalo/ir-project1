<p>Stocks ended mixed on Tuesday, as falling bond interest rates lifted blue-chip shares, but a series of profit warnings sparked a sell-off in technology shares.</p>
<p>The dollar fell after the German government and central bank neared a compromise over plans to revalue the country's gold reserves, restoring some confidence in the German mark.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average rose 22.75 points to 7,312.15 after hitting a session low of 7,253.78 and then jumping by more than 50 points.</p>
<p>In the broader market, advancing issues outpaced declines by 1,473 to 1,022 on volume of almost 527 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Blue chips were aided by a decline in interest rates, which fuelled a strong advance by financial stocks.</p>
<p>The bond market rose for the fourth straight day in a row, boosted by technical factors. The 30-year Treasury bond rose 12/32, or $3.75 on a $1,000 bond, reducing its yield to 6.87 percent from 6.90 percent at Monday's close. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.</p>
<p>But the story for technology stocks was far different. The Nasdaq composite index fell 19.88 points to 1,384.91, hit by steep losses among computer networking stocks.</p>
<p>Triggering the sell-off was a warning late Monday from Cabletron Systems Inc. that its first-quarter earnings would fall well short of Wall Street estimates.</p>
<p>Analysts said the severe reaction showed investor nerves remain frayed after Friday's surprise warning of disappointing second-quarter results by computer chip bellwether Intel Corp.</p>
<p>&quot;Today looks like a continuation of the reaction -- I'd say overreaction -- to Intel's statement,&quot; said Peggy Farley, chief executive at Amas Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;People are still afraid to hold techs and generally buy them for a quick gain, which makes them the last group to gain and the first to go down,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Also late Monday, disk drive maker Seagate Technology Inc. said its fiscal fourth-quarter results would fall short of expectations.</p>
<p>In the currency markets, the dollar edged down to 1.7275 marks late Tuesday from 1.7305 marks late Monday. It also fell slightly to 116.05 Japanese yen from 116.59 at Monday's close.</p>
<p>Coffee prices rose as attention turned to tight supplies and the wintry weather in Brazil's coffee region this month.</p>
<p>At the Coffee Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York, coffee for July delivery closed 10.25 cents a pound higher at 264.20 cents.</p>
<p>At the New York Mercantile Exchange, oil prices closed lower in anticipation of increases in oil and product stocks and production in weekly data from the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Crude oil for July delivery fell 65 cents a barrel to close at $20.33, with July unleaded gasoline ending down 1.55 cents a gallon at 61.44 cents and July heating oil down 1.70 cents a gallon at 54.62 cents.</p>
<p>At the New York Cotton Exchange, orange juice prices edged higher on talk of a possible threat to Florida citrus groves from the Mediterranean fruit fly, a dreaded pest.</p>
<p>Frozen concentrated orange juice for July delivery closed 0.45 cent a pound higher at 77.50 cents.</p>
<p>Overseas, London's FTSE 100 index closed 5.0 points lower at 4,557.8, its fifth straight decline and its lowest close in four weeks. In Tokyo, the 225-share Nikkei average finished the session at 20,563.16, up 111.31 points, or 0.54 percent. It was the highest close since 20,568.38 on Dec. 11.</p>
