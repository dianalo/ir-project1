<title>USA: U.S. money managers lower cash positions -- MCM.</title>
<headline>U.S. money managers lower cash positions -- MCM.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-07-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. fixed-income managers held their dollar-weighted durations on their debt portfolios mostly steady, but cash positions dropped for the second consecutive week, an MCM MoneyWatch Inc survey said.</p>
<p>&quot;Cash positions fell further ... but are still above the December (1996) lows,&quot; said MCM MoneyWatch vice president Astrid Adolfson, who conducts the weekly survey.</p>
<p>The drop may be attributed to quarter-end &quot;windowdressing,&quot; because both ends of the yield curve became overweighted, Adolfson added.  </p>
<p>In the week ending June 30, durations as a percentage of benchmark inched lower to 108.0 from 108.1 percent.</p>
<p>A duration reading above 100 percent indicates the group of investors polled is mostly long on the market.</p>
<p>A portfolio's duration represents its average maturity and is used by portfolio managers to calculate exposure to risk.</p>
<p>In the &quot;next likely move&quot; category, portfolio managers representing 32 percent of total assets in the survey said they would &quot;buy,&quot; unchanged from the prior week.</p>
<p>Strategists leaning toward &quot;sell&quot; held steady at 19 percent.  </p>
<p>Forty-nine percent of managers said they were &quot;neutral&quot; on the market.</p>
<p>Cash as a percentage of assets fell to 2.75 percent from 2.84 percent registered the previous week.</p>
<p>The survey showed 33 percent of investors polled overweighted the 10-plus years duration sector, up from 31 percent the previous week, while 9.0 percent underweighted it.</p>
<p>The remaining 58 percent were &quot;neutral.&quot;</p>
<p>In the five- to 10-year duration sector, 50 percent of investors polled said they overweighted the securities and 11 percent underweighted them.  </p>
<p>The survey included 38 domestic participants who manage about $110 billion in fixed-income assets. The poll is conducted weekly by MCM and usually is released on Tuesday.</p>
