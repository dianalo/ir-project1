<p>Thousands of Rwandan refugees streamed into Sake at the northern tip of Lake Kivu in east Zaire on Wednesday, some reporting massacres by Hutu militiamen who apparently tried to stem the flow home.</p>
<p>&quot;On the second day of walking we had got outside of the camp, when the Interahamwe (militia) killed three or four thousand people, west of the camp,&quot; one refugee said.</p>
<p>&quot;More than a thousand are arriving in Sake each hour from the direction of the Masisi,&quot; said a U.N. refugee agency official standing at the entrance to the town.</p>
<p>Thirty trucks were waiting to ferry them to Goma at the border, and then back home to Rwanda.</p>
<p>Refugee Prosper Ndukireyimenze said in Sake:&quot;I left Katale camp on the 31st of October. Before we left the area around Katale, on the second day, the militias killed a huge group of people.&quot;</p>
<p>The reports could not be confirmed independently.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Canada, which is heading plans to send an armed intervention force to east Zaire to help feed the refugees, showed some impatience with its international allies and said it was considering air drops of food to the region.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no clear-cut agreement on specific measures. Many are still claiming that they need more information,&quot; Foreign Secretary Lloyd Axworthy said in Ottawa.</p>
<p>Axworthy also said he wanted a base for the military operation set up speedily in Entebbe, Uganda.</p>
<p>The Rwandan government says there is no need for the force, since, it believes, almost all the refugees have returned home, and it has refused to let the mission be based in Rwanda.</p>
<p>Uganda said it was happy for the base to be at Entebbe.</p>
<p>In Minova, 17 km (10 miles) south of Sake, more than 15,000 Rwandan refugees from camps around Bukavu, south of the lake, were in a makeshift camp on the edge of the water, prevented from moving on by men who may have been members of militias.</p>
<p>&quot;The Zairean rebels have said that we cannot move further towards Sake because of insecurity on the road. We are dying here, we have no food, no water and no firewood,&quot; said Emmanuel Nyamahunga, 35, who said he was a member of the committee controlling the camp in Minova.</p>
<p>Rebel soldiers said the refugees were not being stopped from moving north, and the threats and instructions from Nyamahunga and his colleagues seemed to be the main reasons why the refugees were not moving.</p>
<p>Nyamahunga said he was not going home to Rwanda.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not that I don't want to, it's that I can't. I haven't killed people, but I know I will be treated as a killer,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;But we are telling these people to stay here, not to move to Sake, and so they are doing as they are told,&quot; continued Nyamahunga. &quot;When we get back to Rwanda, there will be a war much worse than the one in 1994.&quot;</p>
<p>The refugees fled Rwanda in 1994 after a Tutsi-led army overran the country following the genocide of Tutsis by extremists linked to the then Hutu-dominated government.</p>
<p>Aid agencies estimated there were 1.2 million refugees in eastern Zaire until mid-November, when they were forced to flee their camps as the rebel Zaireans fought Zairean government troops and Rwandan Hutu extremists.</p>
<p>Up to 600,000 are estimated to have now returned home.</p>
