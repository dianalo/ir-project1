<headline>Asia Product Swap-Gas oil dips as buyers sidelined.</headline>
<dateline>SINGAPORE 1997-07-28</dateline>

<p>Singapore gas oil swaps slipped from morning levels on Monday as initial expectations that physical buyers would prop up demand started to wane, traders and brokers said.</p>
<p>August gas oil swaps were last offered at $22.95 with a bid heard notionally at $22.75. August indications were lower from morning quotes at $23.00/$23.20.</p>
<p>September was last quoted at $23.20/$23.40, down 20 cents from morning indications.</p>
<p>Brokers said there was a lack of buying interest in the swaps market while more offers were seen.  </p>
<p>Sentiment in the physical market now appeared less euphoric than it was last week when a number of traders purchased a total of 1.1 million barrels in the first four days.</p>
<p>But physical gas oil prices started to soften on Friday, losing about 10 cents as buyers moved to the sidelines while a major made aggressive offers.</p>
<p>Some traders said Friday's dip might be the start of a downtrend.</p>
<p>They cited poor demand from China and high stocks both on the mainland and Singapore and an overhang seen in the prompt market.  </p>
<p>Singapore middle distillate stocks for the week ending July 23 rose by 469,000 barrels to 11.084 million, the Trade Development Board said on Thursday.t.</p>
<p>But a few bulls remained. A handful of traders cited support from a healthy crude market and the recent spate of strong buying interests by traders who were primarily covering their short-positions into Indonesia.</p>
<p>Traders also noted that current levels could be sustained as Asia enters the fourth quarter, when buyers traditionally start to buy to stock up for the upcoming winter.</p>
