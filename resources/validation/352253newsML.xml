<title>FRANCE: PSA shares fall on January sales.</title>
<headline>PSA shares fall on January sales.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-02-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>Shares in carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroen were down sharply on Monday after the French carmakers association (CCFA) reported its unit sales fell 43 percent in January, compared with the market's 33.6 percent decline.</p>
<p>PSA Peugeot Citroen shares were down 3.04 percent at 575 francs at 1535 GMT.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman at the Peugeot group said it underperformed the market in January because the company, struggling to preserve its profit margins, resisted price cuts until mid-January. &quot;We saw everyone doing aggressive promotions, and we joined on January 15,&quot; the spokeswoman told Reuters.</p>
<p>Renault, whose sales were down 29.3 percent, fared slightly better than the market as a whole, but its shares were down 0.92 percent at 118 francs.</p>
<p>The drop in January sales was due in part to inflated sales in January 1996 due to a spillover of December orders after the disruption caused by public transport strikes late in 1995 and by a year-long state rebate scheme that expired last September.</p>
<p>PSA shares rose sharply on January 30 after Natwest Sellier issued a &quot;buy&quot; note on the stock, traders said.</p>
