<title>TAIWAN: Taiwan stocks rebound as investors hunt bargains.</title>
<headline>Taiwan stocks rebound as investors hunt bargains.</headline>
<dateline>TAIPEI 1997-03-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>Taiwan share prices finished higher on Thursday, recovering more than half of what was lost on Wednesday with investors seeing bargains in the market despite its big 1997 rise, brokers said.</p>
<p>The benchmark stock index had moved as high as 8,522.70 but ended with a gain of 51.15 points or 0.61 percent at 8,492.67.</p>
<p>Turnover was T$145.105 billion, still heavy but well below Wednesday's seven-year high of T$195.7 billion.</p>
<p>Analysts said the reduced turnover came as a relief to investors and brokers who had feared that a further rise in the volume could trigger intervention by the central bank.  </p>
<p>&quot;Bargain hunting prevailed throughout the day's trade, following Wednesday's 84-point fall, with investors buying in steel and paper shares due to their relatively low prices,&quot; said National Securities analyst Oliver Fang.</p>
<p>Fang said the red-hot bourse, which has gained more than 23 percent in 1997, appeared to be entering a consolidation phase and cited the reduced trade volume as evidence.</p>
<p>Brokers said investors are cautious after Wednesday's fall, but many were reluctant to withdraw from such a hot market.</p>
<p>Lower-priced shares including steels and papers were the day's favourite, gaining 2.6 and 2.07 percent, respectively.  </p>
<p>China Steel, which had lagged the market's recent gains, rose T$0.4 to T$27.8 while Mayer Steel Pipe advanced T$1.8 to T$28.10.</p>
<p>Wan Yu Paper rose T$1.2 to T$19.2 and leading printer Chun Yu Works rose T$1.8 to T$27.6.</p>
<p>A trading range of 8,400-8,600 was seen for Friday.</p>
