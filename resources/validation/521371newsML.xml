<headline>UK's Crest faces test with A&amp;L floatation.</headline>

<p>Crest, the electronic system used to settle trades on the London Stock Exchange, faces the first in a series of critical tests of its processing power next week when Alliance &amp; Leicester (A&amp;L) floats its shares.</p>
<p>Crest, which recently bolstered its computer capacity by 60 percent, said on Friday it had enhanced its software and plans to extend its hours to accommodate the onslaught of new shares from UK building societies such as the A&amp;L.</p>
<p>&quot;We're confident that Crest and the market can handle the increased volume from Alliance &amp; Leicester,&quot; said Paul Symons, managing director of Crest.</p>
<p>Concerns about Crest's ability to handle the huge flow of paper from the flotation were raised a few weeks ago when the system slowed down, creating a big backlog of orders, as end-of-tax year deals clogged up the pipelines.</p>
<p>He said that the biggest day for Crest in terms of volume would be on April 28, when the A&amp;L transactions need to settle.</p>
<p>Twenty-seven percent of A&amp;L shareholders have already committed to selling on the first day. Most other bargains will be dealt with in aggregate as Crest streamlines subsequent deals, putting less of a strain on the system.</p>
<p>But the biggest demutualisation won't come until June, when Halifax floats its shares.</p>
<p>That will be only one of many hurdles to follow.</p>
<p>&quot;...There is a daunting menu of changes and challenges for all of us,&quot; CRESTCo chief executive Iain Saville wrote to users in a recent newsletter.</p>
<p>He said Crest also was preparing for the introduction of the London Stock Exchange's electronic order-matching system in October. While this probably means more volume for Crest, it would not entail further software adjustments, Symons said.</p>
<p>A possible European Monetary Union could require some changes, but additional processing capacity won't be necessary, Crest said.</p>
<p>That's because Crest already operates a multi-currency platform, but in addition to introduce the euro as another currency, it also will require the formation of a group of euro payment banks to assume intraday payment obligations in Crest and settle bilateral net payments with each other at the end of the day.</p>
