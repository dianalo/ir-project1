<p>The White House urged Congress Thursday to postpone some proposed changes to Medicare and consider them as part of a long-term solution to the federal health problem and not part of next year's budget.</p>
<p>Medicare provisions in the Senate bill included gradually raising the eligibility age from 65 to 67 and linking Medicare premiums to family income.</p>
<p>White House budget director Franklin Raines said those measures were not needed to balance the budget by 2002 and should be considered &quot;as part of a bipartisan process to address the long-term financing challenges facing Medicare.&quot;</p>
<p>There was general agreement to set up a commission to study the future of Medicare, which will be strained when baby boomers start retiring less than 15 years from now.</p>
<p>Raines wrote the chairmen of the House and Senate budget committees outlining provisions in spending bills passed by the two chambers that he said either violated the balanced budget agreement negotiated between Congress and the White House or presented the White House with policy concerns.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect and will insist that the final budget legislation conform to the budget agreement,&quot; he wrote in a 20-page list of objections and concerns about the Medicare health programme for people over age 65, the state-federal Medicaid programme for the poor and other domestic programmes.</p>
<p>The House and the Senate next week were expected to start working out the differences between their two versions of the spending bill. The White House hoped provisions it found most objectionable could be addressed in those negotiations.</p>
<p>Raines' letter did not raise any threat of a veto.</p>
<p>He also noted White House concern about Medicaid funding for disabled children who are losing their Supplememental Social Security income because of new eligibility definitions.</p>
<p>The White House also objected to a provision that would expand and prolong a ban on using Medicaid money for abortions.</p>
