<headline>BOXING-LEWIS IS CONFIDENT AGAINST MCCALL.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-01-21</dateline>

<p>Oliver McCall knocked him down once, but it won't happen when they meet again next month for the vacant World Boxing Council (WBC) heavyweight championship promised Lennox Lewis.</p>
<p>&quot;Oliver McCall had his eyes closed when he threw that punch,&quot; Lewis said of the hammering right hand that sent him to the canvas in the second round of his title defence against the American in London on Sept. 24, 1995.</p>
<p>It appeared, however, that McCall deftly ducked beneath Lewis' defence and landed a classic right to drop Lewis.</p>
<p>Lewis staggered to his feet clearly hurt, and referee Lupe Garcia stopped the bout, handing the Briton his only defeat in 30 professional fights.</p>
<p>McCall, 28-6, subsquently lost the belt to Lewis' countryman Frank Bruno, who then surrendered the title with little opposition to Mike Tyson last March.</p>
<p>When Tyson choose to relinquish the WBC crown to fight Evander Holyfield instead of the mandatory challenger Lewis, who took &quot;step-aside money,&quot; it set up the February 7 rematch at the Las Vegas Hilton.</p>
<p>&quot;You only get lucky once in a lifetime and for that to happen again is virtually impossible,&quot; Lewis said, of his first fight with McCall, in a tele-conference Tuesday from his training camp in Scottsdale, Arizona.</p>
<p>McCall has had a rocky road leading up to the fight.</p>
<p>He was arrested last month on a variety of charges after throwing a Christmas tree in a hotel lobby, and recently entered a third drug rehabilitation programme.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not interested in that,&quot; Lewis said of McCall's troubles. &quot;That's not my concern. I'm more concerned that when he steps up in the ring he will be up against a man looking to beat him.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not taking him lightly and am looking forward to meeting him in the ring again,&quot; Lewis said.</p>
<p>Lewis last fought seven months ago when he held on to beat Ray Mercer by decision.</p>
<p>&quot;The waiting is what I can't take,&quot; Lewis said of his long layoff. &quot;I wish the fight was yesterday.&quot;</p>
