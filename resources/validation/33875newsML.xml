<p>Paris Saint-Germain put their French title credentials to the test on Friday against a Monaco side featuring a Brazilian they badly wanted as the last piece in their championship jigsaw.</p>
<p>Sonny Anderson, who said he wants to stay at Monaco and would rather play abroad than in Paris, looks set to return from injury to lead the best attack in the first division against the only side with a clean sheet after five rounds.</p>
<p>&quot;I've had enough of this Parisian rumour saying I'm on my way to PSG,&quot; said Anderson, who missed Monaco's crushing 5-1 win over early pacesetters Lens on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not right to try to destabilise us a few hours before our match. I'm a Monaco player and I intend to honour my three-year contract. And if I leave the principality, it will be to go to Italy or Spain.</p>
<p>&quot;It's our year, the chance now or never to be champions,&quot; added the Brazilian, who turns 26 this month.</p>
<p>The division's strongest defence has been built by Anderson's compatriot Ricardo, who returned to PSG as manager this season after helping them win their last title in 1994 as an accomplished centre-back.</p>
<p>His side represents more than just an impenetrable rearguard, however.</p>
<p>With two more Brazilians, Rai and Leonardo, creating chances from midfield and forwards Julio Cesar Dely Valdes of Panama, Cameroon Patrick's Mbouma and French veteran Laurent Fournier in good form they will be looking to add to their seven goals in the clash at Parc des Princes.</p>
<p>Nigerians Viktor Ikpeba of Monaco and Godwin Opkara, who plays for Strasbourg, will both be looking to add to the two goals they scored on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Opkara hit the only goals conceded so far by champions Auxerre, who fell 2-1 at Strasbourg in their last league game before facing Ajax Amsterdam in their European Cup debut next week and will be looking to bounce back at home to winless Caen.</p>
<p>Lens will be looking for a quick recovery at home to fifth-placed Cannes.</p>
<p>The Cote d'Azur side are in no mood to allow anyone to spoil their good run.</p>
<p>&quot;It was our third away win,&quot; said coach Guy Lacombe after Tuesday's 1-0 win at Guingamp. &quot;But beware Lens. After the slap in the face they got in the principality, we must tread warily.&quot;</p>
<p>Jean-Pierre Papin's Bordeaux defend the only other unbeaten record at Nice in one of two matches on Sunday. Bastia are at home to resurgent Marseille in the other.</p>
