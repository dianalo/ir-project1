<headline>Israeli shekel stable against dollar, basket.</headline>
<dateline>TEL AVIV 1997-05-05</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Israeli shekel's representative rate was fixed almost unchanged against the dollar and the basket of key foreign currencies on Monday in quiet trading, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Trading was very quiet today and activity was low. The shekel closed almost unchanged after the Bank of Israel intervened in the market, buying dollars, to push the basket upwards,&quot; said Guy Levi at Bank Leumi.</p>
<p>The central bank has been intervening regularly in the market to support the currency basket, which has been trading at the bottom end of its band for three months.</p>
<p>The representative rate for the dollar was fixed at 3.4110 shekels against 3.4100 on Friday. The basket, composed of the dollar, mark, pound sterling, French franc and yen, was fixed at 3.6815 shekels against 3.6808 on Friday.</p>
<p>On the crosses, the shekel traded against the yen at 2.6964 shekels per 100 yen compared with 2.6935 on Friday, and against the mark at 1.9744 shekels compared with 1.9805 on Friday.</p>
<p>In the late afternoon, the dollar was trading at 3.4080 shekels.</p>
