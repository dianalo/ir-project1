<p>U.S. Plains feedlot cattle sales turned brisk following a light start near midday Tuesday at $63.00 per cwt, unchanged from light sales on Monday and most of last week, feedlot sources said.</p>
<p>About 8,000 head sold in Kansas and about 10,000 in the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma area.</p>
<p>&quot;I wouldn't be surprised if they (packers) hit it fast and then back off after they buy all the top cattle,&quot; one Kansas feedlot source said, &quot;They're being pretty picky,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Packers had been expected to buy cattle early this week because of the Independence Day holiday on Friday.  </p>
<p>With the early sales, packers and feedlots will have time to get paperwork in order and have cattle ready to be picked up early next week, several feedlot sources said.</p>
<p>Cattle performance has been rated 'excellent' and the advent of extremely hot weather in Nebraska, Kansas and the Panhandle has not affected weight gains because temperatures and humidity have been going down in the evening, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;The cattle just change their eating habits; they eat at night instead of during the day,&quot; one Panhandle feedlot manager said.</p>
