<p>Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel thanked shareholders on Friday for backing its debt restructuring deal and said it was confident of improving its performance after being freed from its financial shackles.</p>
<p>Eurotunnel's board spelled out its post debt-deal vision at a shareholder meeting in London the day after its momentous extraordinary general meeting in Paris where shareholders gave near-unanimous backing to the 8.6 billion pounds ($14.5 billion) debt restructuring plan, thereby avoiding possible bankruptcy.</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday's decision was of historic proportions,&quot; said George Malpas, co-chairman who described Thursday's make-or-break meeting in Paris as &quot;noisy and contentious.&quot;</p>
<p>Patrick Ponsolle, group executive chairman, said Friday's meeting saw &quot;a cowed and quiet audience&quot; in comparison to the high emotions of Thursday's six and a half hour marathon in Paris.</p>
<p>After receiving stinging attacks from some shareholders in Paris, British shareholders provided a contrast for the Eurotunnel board.</p>
<p>&quot;I'd like to congratulate the board,&quot; said one British investor. &quot;They must have had a very difficult time over the last few months. It's nice to see they still have some hair left.&quot;</p>
<p>The restructuring package covered 8.6 billion pounds in junior debt and cut shareholders equity to 54.5 percent from 100 percent, giving creditor banks 45.5 percent.</p>
<p>Bill Dix, managing director of the Le Shuttle tunnel service for lorries and cars, told the meeting that the future looked more promising and stable.</p>
<p>He said Eurotunnel was aiming for 50 to 55 percent of the cross-Channel market share by the year end and said the group was also enjoying a premium over ferry prices which he saw as a key development.</p>
<p>Finance Director Richard Shirrets said the next key milestone will be passed by the group when it breaks even.</p>
<p>&quot;The performance so far this year makes us confident that objective will be met.&quot;</p>
<p>The group's three-year plan aims to have a 45 percent increase in traffic for the Shuttle by 1999.</p>
<p>Eurotunnel sees revenues rising by 15 percent by that year and operating costs falling by 13 percent to 316 million pounds. Operating profits are seen at 215 million by 1999.</p>
<p>Outlining risks which remain once the debt-deal has finally been cleared by the remaining banks later this autumn, Eurotunnel said there was continued uncertainty over whether P&amp;O Plc and Stena would merge their cross-Channel ferry routes and reduce capacity.</p>
<p>Reduced capacity would cut future risk of price wars with the tunnel.</p>
<p>Another risk would be if the planned high-speed link between London and Folkestone was delayed beyond its 2004 launch.</p>
<p>That link is seen as key to boosting traffic into the tunnel. The last threat is a change in economic conditions which could impact on traffic.</p>
<p>But the group said its new financial stability made it better able to face the future.</p>
