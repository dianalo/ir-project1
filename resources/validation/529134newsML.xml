<headline>LIFFE coffee rises but rangebound in slow AM trade.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>LIFFE robusta coffee futures were modestly up but rangebound by Tuesday midsession with nearby months holding at session lows.</p>
<p>Conditions were slow and midday volume of a meagre 1,821 lots were dominated by May/July and July/Sept switches.</p>
<p>Floor sources said light fund buying emerged during mid-morning. However overhead trade selling prevented the market from making much headway.</p>
<p>By the midday pause, May stood $5 higher at $1,648. July gained $7 at $1,676 after a high of $1,685.</p>
<p>There has been a gradual unwinding of the May position ahead of its first tender day on May 1.</p>
<p>By the close of business on Monday, May's uncovered positions fell by 642 lots to 9,925. May/July switches were traded at $28 under and July/Sept $8-$10 under.</p>
<p>Traders called New York to open unchanged to one cent lower based on London's performance.</p>
<p>All eyes focussed on the ongoing Colombian truck drivers' strike which entered a third day on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Talks aimed at ending the strike ended with an agreement on Monday and both the government and the unions were due to resume negotiations on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Traders said coffee shipments could be disrupted if the stoppage is prolonged.</p>
<p>New York's front-month May position enters first notice day on Tuesday against the backdrop of low certified coffee stocks and high open interest.</p>
<p>Traders expect further liquidation against May after Monday's heavy bout of selling which took the U.S. market lower.</p>
<p>In London, the top of July's range was marked by a chart gap between Monday's high of $1,705 and the March 12 low of $1,730.</p>
<p>Strong support rested near $1,600, a level amid an area where several moving averages and trendlines meet, analysts said. -- Jalil Hamid, London newsroom +44 171 542 4985</p>
