<headline>Stocks fall for 3rd session, bonds rise.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK</dateline>
<text>
<p>Stocks fell for a third consecutive session Wednesday after hitting four record highs last week. Bonds edged higher and the dollar ended mixed.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, crude oil prices fell and gold edged lower.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average ended 25.34 points lower at 6,036.46 after being down nearly 70 points at one time.</p>
<p>In the broader market, declining issues led advances 1,261 to 1,061 on active volume of 439 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a recovery in the recently battered high technology stocks helped shore up the Nasdaq Composite index, which ended up 7.88 points to 1,227.88 after losing a total of 22 points on Monday and Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The techs are looking strong as we close out the day. Intel, Microsoft, Cisco and IBM have had very nice rebounds,&quot; said Peter Canelo, chief investment strategist at Dean Witter.</p>
<p>&quot;The correction for techs in terms of time may go on for awhile but it's mostly over in terms of price,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Analysts said the market was looking to the November elections.</p>
<p>&quot;What we are seeing is a discounting process ahead of the election in November,&quot; said Joseph Barthel, chief investment strategist at Fahnestock &amp; Co.</p>
<p>He said traders were considering the possibility of Democrats riding President Clinton's coattails to retake one or both houses of Congress.</p>
<p>&quot;Wall Street likes Clinton with a Republican Congress,&quot; Barthel said.</p>
<p>Treasury securities posted their first gains of the week after digesting another fresh dose of supply.</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year bond rose 10/32, or $3.125 on a $1,000 bond, lowering its yield to 6.83 percent from 6.85 percent on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The dollar fell against the German mark as German officials hinted they will not lower interest rates soon, but rallied against the Japanese yen on an unconfirmed report that Washington approved of the dollar's recent rally.</p>
<p>The dollar fell to 1.5212 marks from 1.5254 late Tuesday. It rebounded from early lows against the yen to break 113 yen for the first time in 33 months, ending at 112.93 yen, up from 112.29 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In commodities trading, heating oil prices tumbled after an industry report on Tuesday indicated stockpiles may be rising from record lows. Heating oil for November delivery fell 2.49 cents to 70.96 cents a gallon at the New York Mercantile Exchange.</p>
<p>The selling weighed on crude oil, with December crude losing 67 cents to $24.86 a barrel. November gasoline lost 0.96 cent to 68.16 cents a gallon.</p>
<p>December gold lost 20 cents to $385.90 an ounce at New York's Commodity Exchange.</p>
<p>Overseas, London's FTSE 100 index fell 28.8 points to 4,028.4. Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei 225 closed down 41.53 points at 21,082.15.</p>
