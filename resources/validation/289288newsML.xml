<p>Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on Monday criticised Arab leaders who contributed to the U.S-led multinational force that ejected his troops from Kuwait in the 1991 Gulf War.</p>
<p>In an address marking the 76th anniversary of the Iraqi armed forces, he said Arab countries that sided with the United States and its allies should have directed their war effort against the occupation of Arab land by Israel, Syria and Iran.</p>
<p>Shortly after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, Arab leaders met in Cairo and many decided to take part in the international military efforts to free it from Iraqi occupation.</p>
<p>&quot;Why did they not meet on the fringes of the known crisis in Lebanon?...Why did they not meet against Iran's occupation of islands in the Arabian Gulf?...</p>
<p>&quot;Why did they not meet and reach the minimum of military action when the Iranians captured the (Iraqi) Arab city of Fao and decide on what action to take against the continuing Zionist aggression on Lebanon...and its occupation of Arab land?&quot; Saddam said in the address carried by the official media.</p>
<p>In the run-up to the war over Kuwait, Saddam linked any withdrawal by his army to a pullout by Syria from Lebanon, by Israel from Gaza and the West Bank, and by Iran from three Islands it captured from the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>Saddam said the decision by Arab leaders to fight Iraq in the war did not stem from &quot;national or pan-Arab principles&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Those concerned among the Arab leaders reaped nothing other than weakness and the plunder undertaken by the foreigner of Arab riches,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Saddam, wearing his ceremonial field marshal's uniform, urged Arabs to open a new chapter and march &quot;on a path that essentially leads to the service of the Arab nation, its poor and those Arabs who have lost their food, national and medical security and the simplest means of living and life&quot;.</p>
<p>Saddam said that despite the departure of &quot;the army of the mother of battles&quot; from Kuwait, many Arab leaders continued their stance of &quot;rancour, evil and conspiracies&quot; towards Iraq.</p>
<p>He told Arab leaders that their small or large-scale summits would not solve problems besetting the Arab nation.</p>
<p>&quot;Such policies are fruitless, particularly when their declared headlines are related to Iraq, whose case now belongs to all honourable Arabs.&quot;</p>
<p>He said that in their meetings, Arab leaders repeated statements advocated by Western countries who conspired against Iraq under the cover of U.N. Security Council resolutions.</p>
<p>Saddam praised the Arab leaders who stood with Iraq during &quot;the eternal mother of battles&quot; and those calling for a lifting of U.N. sanctions against it.</p>
<p>Iraq has to comply with a host of U.N. resolutions, notably those related to the dismantling of weapons of mass destruction, before sanctions can be removed.</p>
<p>Late last year, Iraq resumed partial oil sales worth $2 billion over six months as part of a U.N. deal to alleviate the suffering of its people.</p>
<p>In his 25-minute speech, Saddam made no mention of his country's relations with the Security Council and a current dispute over the counting of long-range missiles banned under the Gulf War ceasefire terms.</p>
