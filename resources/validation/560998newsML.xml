<title>BELGIUM: Commission delays mad cow, gelatine measures.</title>
<headline>Commission delays mad cow, gelatine measures.</headline>
<dateline>BRUSSELS 1997-05-05</dateline>
<text>
<p>The European Commission has postponed until next week a proposal for further measures, including a ban on exports of British gelatine, to combat mad cow disease, Commission officials said on Monday.</p>
<p>Food safety commissioner Emma Bonino, who is trying to speed up implementation of advice given by scientific committees, said last week she hoped the proposal would be adopted this week.</p>
<p>But officials said the proposal, which is being drawn up with Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler, had not yet been vetted by the 20 commissioners' aides.</p>
<p>On April 3, the multidisciplinary scientific committee raised doubts about the safety of British gelatine and the Commission had been expected to restore the ban by May 1.</p>
<p>The gelatine ban was part of a worldwide embargo on British beef exports imposed by the EU in March 1996 after London admitted a link between the disease, known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), and a human equivalent, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD).</p>
<p>Although the European Commission controversially eased in June 1996 a ban on gelatine made from British beef, it has not approved any such exports because British manufacturers failed to meet the strict heat processing pre-conditions.</p>
<p>British gelatine producers considered that the terms were so severe that they made production uneconomic. Instead they turned to beef raw materials from other countries.</p>
<p>Officials stressed that the draft gelatine ban was only part of a series of measures to tighten up BSE controls.</p>
<p>Fischler gave member states until the end of April to show that they were properly enforcing new EU rules on meat and bonemeal processing.</p>
<p>Recent EU inspections have shown that member states have not been respecting rules on the disposal of cattle and sheep offal. A number of member states could be taken to court.</p>
<p>Fischler is expected to make a fresh bid to ban specified risk material from cattle and sheep -- brains, eyes, spinal cord and spleen -- from human and animal food.</p>
<p>EU farm ministers rejected the proposal in December arguing that the measures was unnecessary and economically excessive given that their countries were virtually free of BSE and scrapie, a similar brain-wasting disease in sheep.</p>
<p>Infected meat and bonemeal mixed into cattle and sheep feed is believed to be the main cause of BSE.</p>
