<title>FRANCE: Princess Stephanie's husband sues over racy photos.</title>
<headline>Princess Stephanie's husband sues over racy photos.</headline>
<dateline>NICE, France 1996-09-17</dateline>

<p>The husband of Monaco's Princess Stephanie, facing divorce after being photographed on a sex romp with a Belgian stripper, will ask a French court to probe whether he was framed, his lawyer said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Attorney Guillaume Carre said he would file a lawsuit by the weekend on behalf of Daniel Ducruet, whose wife Princess Stephanie filed for divorce after Italian magazines printed graphic pictures of him cavorting with a former &quot;Miss Topless Belgium&quot;, 26-year-old Fily Houteman.</p>
<p>The suit, to be filed in the French city of Nice against unnamed defendants, will enable Ducruet to learn whether the photographs &quot;were an accident or not,&quot; Carre told Reuters, speculating that his client was set up.</p>
<p>&quot;It was certainly not my client who called in the photographers. And given the repercussions, we have the right to ask questions that an investigating magistrate will now have the task of answering,&quot; Carre said.</p>
<p>Ducruet has no plans to contest the divorce, Carre added.</p>
<p>&quot;Our goal is to protect the children,&quot; he said, expressing a hope that his client would be granted extensive rights to visit the couple's two children, Louis and Pauline, aged three and two, after the divorce becomes final.</p>
<p>The French daily France-Soir reported on Tuesday that the couple had agreed that Ducruet, the princess' ex-bodyguard and a former fish merchant, would be paid a monthly allowance of 15,000 francs ($3,000) after the divorce.</p>
<p>Stephanie, 31, glamorous daughter of Prince Rainier and the late actress Grace Kelly, formally began divorce proceedings on Monday after an unsuccessful reconciliation meeting on Sunday.</p>
<p>The princess wrote to her father, as ruler of the tiny Riviera principality, and he was expected to refer the suit to the Monaco court of revision, which is likely to issue a final divorce ruling within three to five weeks, her lawyer Thierry Lacoste said in a brief statement.</p>
<p>The latest upheaval in the Monaco royal family came just before the Grimaldi family celebrates 700 years in power next year, claiming to be the longest-serving European royal dynasty.</p>
<p>Prince Rainier long opposed Stephanie's relationship with Ducruet but finally accepted him into the family last year for the sake of the couple's children.</p>
<p>The Italian magazine Eva Tremila and its sister publication Gente printed page after page of pictures of Houteman undressing Ducruet, the pair entwined on a sunbed and finally both naked by a poolside.</p>
<p>The principality banned the magazines but copies circulated widely and a video was reported to be on sale at the nearby Italian border town of Ventimiglia.</p>
