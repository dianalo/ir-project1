<p>Rains fell across central Illinois on Monday but amounts and coverage were lighter than expected, Weather Services Corp said.</p>
<p>&quot;We had a little more rain yesterday but again, I don't think it was enough to end the drought concerns,&quot; WSC meteorologist Mike Palmerino said. &quot;I think they (rains) were less than expected. &quot;It was a little bit disappointing. It could have produced better than it did.&quot;</p>
<p>Palmerino said 0.10 to 0.50 inch fell across central Illinois, below some outlooks for 0.50 to 1.50 inch. Coverage was put at 70 percent north of Champaign.  </p>
<p>Points south of Champaign received isolated light showers of less than a quarter of an inch, Palmerino said.</p>
<p>Long-range forecasts suggested another heat wave may move into Illinois, Iowa and Missouri this weekend with no rain expected until Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;There are signs today as we go into the end of the week and into the weekend, we have some building high pressure projected,&quot; Palmerino said. &quot;We've got the potential to produce temperatures into the 90s (degrees Fahrenheit), maybe the upper 90s, across central Iowa southward to central and western Illinois and Missouri.&quot;  </p>
<p>Palmerino said showers of 0.20 to 0.60 inch were possible across those dry areas on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;It would not be a drought-breaking type of a condition,&quot; he said. Maybe 0.20 to 0.60 inch with scattered coverage.&quot;</p>
<p>The U.S. Agriculture Department on Monday said corn and soybean conditions declined in the week ended Sunday. Persistent hot, dry weather stressed the crops, traders said.</p>
