<p>The judicial managers of trading and property-based Amcol Holdings are planning to sell the shares of its Mauritian joint venture company, the daily Business Times said on Monday.</p>
<p>The newspaper said Amcol's judicial managers, Price Waterhouse, had obtained power of sale over all the shares of the joint venture company, Guibes Holdings Ltd, and were looking for a broker to sell the shares to interested parties.</p>
<p>The judicial managers were not available for comment.  </p>
<p>Amcol is being rescued by Indonesia's Sinar Mas through the creation of a new company and an injection of assets worth more than US$2.0 billion, after a special audit last year found the company was in financial trouble.</p>
<p>Amcol had invested in a 40 percent stake in the joint venture company with Mauritian businessman Roland Maural's Sando &amp; Cie in a deal to develop a casino, racetrack and resort on the island.  </p>
<p>BT said the Mauritian government had valued a 41 percent stake in the casino at about US$11 million. Guibes' other assets include land for the racetrack and the hotel, resort and residential development near Port Louis, the capital.</p>
<p>Maurel had earlier agreed to return the money invested by Amcol, said to be US$39.6 million, after the judicial managers decided to abort the deal following discovery of irregularities, the Business Times said.</p>
<p>After Maurel failed to meet a January 31 deadline, the judical managers filed a notice against six companies owned by Maurel, including Guibes, it said.  </p>
<p>A further notice was served on his Mauritian bank accounts to block any move by him to dispose of his shares in the six companies and to deny him access to funds in his bank accounts, it added.</p>
