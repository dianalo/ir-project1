<p>Real Madrid defensive giant Fernando Hierro will take on his carbon-copy on Saturday as the Spanish league leaders face third-placed Real Betis.</p>
<p>Much of Betis' success this season has been built on Roberto Rios, a player who many fans see as Hierro's natural successor in the Spanish national team.</p>
<p>Curiously both men play in defence at club level, but show their versatility by moving up to midfield in the international side.</p>
<p>Rios came on as substitute for Hierro in Spain's 4-0 win over Malta on Wednesday, and was denied his debut international goal only by a dubious off-side decision, the only one of the entire game.</p>
<p>After winning his first cap in October's World Cup qualifier against the Czech Republic, Rios has attracted the attention of a number of clubs, in addition to the long-standing interest of Athletic Bilbao.</p>
<p>Manchester United manger Alex Ferguson has travelled to several Betis games to watch the linchpin of the Betis defence.</p>
<p>One game he didn't see was Betis' 4-2 home defeat by Barcelona, in which the southerners let in three headed goals by Luis Enrique Martinez and clearly felt the absence of Rios, who was suspended.</p>
<p>But Rios, who at 1.92 metres is one of the tallest players in the Spanish game, is not only adept at stopping goals, he also makes use of his strength in the air to score.</p>
<p>Manuel Ruiz de Lopera has already improved Rios' contract and last season turned down offers from Athletic believed to be in the region of 800 million pesetas ($5.6 million).</p>
<p>Hierro saw his contract renewed in similar circumstances.</p>
<p>Suggestions that Barcelona may try to poach Hierro led club chairman Lorenzo Sanz to increase the player's annual salary to an estimated 300 million pesetas ($2.11 million) and the amount a club that wants to buy him has to pay to a staggering five billion pesetas ($35.1 million).</p>
<p>The move came days after Hierro recovered his scoring touch to knock in free-kicks in successive games.</p>
<p>Hierro, the set-piece specialist at the Santiago Bernabeu for nearly six years, had untill then taken a back seat to Brazilian Roberto Carlos in the dead-ball department this season.</p>
<p>Like Rios, Hierro comes forward strongly, and uses his height well at corners.</p>
<p>And for a big man, he is surprisingly mobile.</p>
<p>He is also a born competitor, regularly turning in captains' performances when the chips are down for Real, while only the perseverance of veteran goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta stands between him and the international captaincy.</p>
<p>When Hierro finally takes over, few doubt that Rios will be one of the men under his command.</p>
