<p>Giddings &amp; Lewis Inc does not expect its $700-million acquisition by Germany's Thyssen AG to be blocked by Defense Department or antitrust reviews, said Giddings chief executive Marvin Isles.</p>
<p>In an interview Thursday with Reuters, Isles said, &quot;We did less than $2 million in total U.S. government sales last year. We don't think it will be a factor whatsoever.&quot;</p>
<p>On antitrust, he said Thyssen has minor U.S. operations. &quot;Most of their capability is outside of North America.  So we don't think that's going to be an issue at all,&quot; Isles said.  </p>
<p>Fond du Lac, Wis.-based Giddings said Thursday it had reached a definitive agreement to be acquired by Thyssen for $21 per share.  That offer topped an earlier, $19-per-share bid by Harnischfeger Industries Inc that had been rejected by the Giddings board as inadequate.</p>
<p>On the Thyssen deal, Isles said, &quot;We will be the premier machine tool company in the world in this combination.&quot;</p>
<p>He added that the merger deal &quot;provided the greatest value to our shareholders, but also was in the best interest of our employees, our communities and our customers.&quot;</p>
<p>Shares in Giddings were up 1-7/8 to 20-7/8.  </p>
<p>Shares in Milwaukee-based Harnischfeger were up 1-3/8 to 42-1/8.  Analysts said they doubted Harnischfeger would raise its bid for Giddings.</p>
<p>Harnischfeger is trying to follow a disciplined acquisition strategy.  &quot;There could be some negative reaction from Harnischfeger shareholders if they were to jump their bid ... I suspect they will take the gain on the stock and look elsewhere,&quot; said Chicago Corp analyst Robert McCarthy.</p>
<p>Giddings' name, managers and headquarters would remain in place under the Thyssen agreement, Isles said.  </p>
<p>No plant closings or layoffs are anticipated, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no operations to consolidate against.  This is a scenario of growth,&quot; Isles said.</p>
<p>Giddings looked at a variety of strategic alternatives after Harnischfeger unveiled its bid in late April.</p>
<p>&quot;Some we discarded after we looked at them.  Out of all of those alternatives ... we determined that this was the best alternative for us,&quot; Isles said.</p>
<p>Thyssen was allowed a closer look at Giddings' books than was Harnischfeger, Isles said.</p>
<p>&quot;Under the confidentiality requirements, which Thyssen met, they had access to information ... Harnischfeger never did agree to our requirements that all other parties agreed to.  So they had less information,&quot; he said.</p>
