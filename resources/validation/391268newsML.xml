<title>USA: Iraqi crude unwanted in saturated U.S. market.</title>
<headline>Iraqi crude unwanted in saturated U.S. market.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-02-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>Iraqi crude oil, which has found buyers in Europe and Asia since the United Nations allowed a limited lifting of sanctions in December, is finding little interest in a saturated U.S. market.</p>
<p>The latest cargo of Iraqi oil offered into the U.S. Gulf Coast under the U.N. oil-for-food accord has failed to attract buyer interest because of sharply declining prices for competing sour crudes, oil traders said Thursday.  </p>
<p>Houston-based Bayoil Trading, one of the contractors for Iraqi oil, postponed from first-half March until April the possible U.S. arrival date for its cargo of Basrah Light in a bid to spark interest, traders said.</p>
<p>Bayoil may offer the crude elsewhere because of the lack of interest, according to trading sources close to the company.</p>
<p>Bayoil had been offering the March-delivery cargo at a $1.70 discount to benchmark West Texas Intermediate/ Cushing (March), traders said. Buyers said that price was too expensive and Bayoil is now asking a $2.00 discount to April WTI/Cushing for April delivery.  </p>
<p>The market for sour crude (which has a high sulphur content) has seen a sharp decline in relative prices since the start of the year, partly because of a heavy program of refinery maintenace in the U.S. Gulf.</p>
<p>&quot;Turnarounds have hit sour crude processing,&quot; said a trader.</p>
<p>Also, supplies from a weak Canadian market, California and Latin America have added to the depressed price state.</p>
<p>&quot;There continues to be a lot of sours coming from the West Coast on the All-American pipeline to the Gulf,&quot; said a trader.  </p>
<p>Price differentials for key domestic U.S. sour grades put West Texas Sour/Midland at around a $2.30-$2.50 discount to the WTI/Cushing, and Eugene Island at $2.25-$2.40 under.</p>
<p>Bearish fundamentals for landing sour barrels into the U.S. Gulf led to the United Nations approving an Iraq State Oil Marketing Organisation (SOMO) request to offer special discounts on Basrah Light to the United States.</p>
<p>In an effort to spur sales, Basrah Light to the U.S. will drop to a $4.30 discount from a previously agreed $3.85 discount to WTI/Cushing for February to March 9, the last day of the first tranche of the oil-for-food deal.  </p>
<p>From March 10, the Basrah Light price will drop to $3.90 under the benchmark.</p>
