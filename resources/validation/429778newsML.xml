<p>Slovakia's burgeoning current account deficit, largely propped up by short-term capital inflows, have prompted renewed concerns of a possible devaluation of the crown, analysts said on Monday.</p>
<p>The National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) released figures on Monday showing the current account had swung to a deficit for 1996 of $1.94 billion, after a revised $391.4 million surplus for the full year of 1995.</p>
<p>While the capital account surplus of $2.14 billion for the same period was enough to cover the shortfall, some analysts said net short-term capital, which can flow out as fast as it comes in, accounted for nearly a half of the figure.</p>
<p>&quot;The figures are worrying. The biggest concern...is that to finance this current account deficit, Slovakia is reliant on short-term capital,&quot; Charlie Robertson an analyst at London-based HILFE told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;The foreign trade trend in January suggests that this is going to worsen. I think there will be lots of concern about whether the present exchange rate can be maintained, and the threat of devaluation some time this year, or certainly going to 1998 is quite real,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The NBS has been fixing the crown between its basket midpoint and the -1.0 percent level of its fluctuation band for nearly one month, pushed lower by outflows of foreign capital as domestic interest rates eased.</p>
<p>Interbank money rates jumped to record levels of over 25 percent in the first weeks of January after the NBS moved to rein in a rapidly growing money supply and cool off a consumption-led boom, widening the current account gap.</p>
<p>Until then, the crown had been fixed within some three percent range around the parity level for over one year.</p>
<p>Analysts estimated the 1997 Slovak current account deficit could widen to more than 12 percent up from an estimated 10 percent of GDP in 1996.</p>
<p>They added the crown's devaluation to over the set fluctuation band did not seem imminent as the need for it could still be offset, at least temporarily.</p>
<p>&quot;Pending on what measures the government is prepared to take to prevent a devaluation, perhaps such as an import surcharge to asssure that there is no devaluation, then the trade deficit may be managable. But it is certainly a very risky territory,&quot; Robertson said.</p>
<p>But added ING Barings analyst, Martin Barto: &quot;As long as the Czech crown does not depreciate to a larger extent, and the NBS foreign exchange reserves continue to linger, any thoughts of the Slovak crown's devaluation are premature.&quot;</p>
<p>The Czech Republic split with former federation partner Slovakia in 1993 but the two remain each other's largest trading partner.</p>
<p>Some analysts also questioned whether a devaluation alone could help an economy facing the need for urgent reforms. &quot;Besides the short-term capital concern, low direct investment in Slovakia is also worrying,&quot; Barto said.</p>
<p>Added Ivan Miklos, an economist at MESA 10 Group: &quot;The situation appears to be leading to devaluation, but the economy's main problem is the low competiteveness of goods, and just devaluation alone could be the first of a chain of devaluations&quot;.</p>
<p>Last week, the NBS said it had been still waiting to see the impact of its moves to reign in credit expansion, though it added that it was prepared to act to support its foreign exchange reserves.</p>
<p>The NBS's hard currency reserves firmed to $3.5 billion to December 31, from $3.424 billion at the beginning of 1996, but they now cover only 3.3 months worth of imports down from 4.0 months at the end of the previous year.</p>
