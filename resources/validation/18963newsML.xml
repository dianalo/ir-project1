<p>The rand's attempt to breach the psychological 4.50 level against the dollar barrier was thwarted on Wednesday by local importers buying dollars at their cheapest level in three weeks.</p>
<p>At the finish, the rand was quoted 4.5050/5100 against the dollar from 4.5190/5240 on Tuesday after touching 4.4950 in the pre-opening trade -- its best level since August 8.</p>
<p>Dealers said the currency was helped at the start of the day by reports that Taiwan planned to build a petrochemical plant valued at more than $3 billion in South Africa.</p>
<p>&quot;We had a fairly bullish start with some dollar selling out of London,&quot; a dealer said. &quot;But after breaking below 4.50, we saw a lot of importer demand which took it back up again.&quot;</p>
<p>After the initial move below key support at the 4.5160/80 level, dealers said resistance had been set at around 4.5150 and the rand traded in a narrow range for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>&quot;We saw some good two-way flows today...good importer demand and some offshore buying below 4.50 and exporters and offshore selling around 4.5150,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Another trader said there had been talk that the Reserve Bank had also helped the rand strengthen on the day by offering dollars through the smaller banks.</p>
<p>Dealers said that in the short-term, the 4.50 level would remain a target, but a breach of that level could herald a rand of 4.48 to the dollar and 4.45 beyond that.</p>
<p>The liquidation of long dollar positions over the last week appeared to be coming to a halt, although a trader said &quot;dribs and drabs&quot; were still helping the currency.</p>
<p>Against the crosses, the rand was trading at 7.0226/0349 on sterling from 6.9984/7.0084 on Tuesday and at 0.3271/3277 marks from 0.3263/3268 marks previously.</p>
<p>Bond yields were helped lower at the opening by the stronger rand, but a lack of significant buying as well as some profit taking resulted in the key R150 retracing from its intraday low of 15.41 percent.</p>
<p>Dealers said volumes on the day had been thin with little or no institutional or foreign interest.</p>
<p>Talk late in the day that July money supply data would &quot;not be as bad as expected&quot; helped the R150 revisit its intraday low shortly after the official close.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank said money supply growth rose 14.69 percent in July -- well below a Reuters consensus forecast of 16.2 percent. Private sector credit extension grew 18.50 percent compared with a revised 18.65 percent in June.</p>
<p>In late trade, the R150 moved lower to test the 15.40 area and was quoted at 15.36 percent at 1530 GMT from 15.48 percent on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Bond Exchange figures showed foreigners were net sellers of 101.45 million rand of South African bonds on Tuesday after buying 41.19 million rand on Monday.</p>
<p>On the money market, three-month NCDs eased to between 16.55 and 16.70 percent from between 16.60 and 16.75 percent on Tuesday and from 16.65 and 16.75 percent on Monday, while 90-day BAs were lower at between 16.00 and 16.10 percent from 16.05 to 16.20 percent previously.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank said the money market shortage eased to 8.705 billion rand on Tuesday from 8.779 billion rand on Monday.</p>
