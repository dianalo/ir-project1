<p>Australia will need to spend about A$12 billion to meet projected demand for new power, Keith Orchison, executive director of the Electricity Supply Association of Australia Ltd said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Some 10,000 megawatts of additional power is required by 2010 to keep pace with growing power needs linked to population growth, Orchison said in an interview.</p>
<p>The additional megawatts would lift Australia's total power capacity to about 48,000 megawatts, Orchison said.</p>
<p>&quot;Demand is being driven by population growth of around 12 percent in the next 10 years,&quot; Orchison said.  </p>
<p>Orchison said that as more power capacity was introduced in Australia, the role of coal as the dominant power-generating source would be eroded in favour of gas.</p>
<p>Coal currently holds about 82 percent of the market, although Orchison saw that share falling to between 50 and 60 percent by 2010.</p>
<p>&quot;Coal-fired stations tend to be tied to their mines, which means inevitably they have to build lots of transmission lines,&quot; Orchison said.</p>
<p>&quot;Gas-line power can be put pretty much where the market is.&quot;  </p>
<p>On top of the A$12 billion in new funding, a further A$14 billion would be needed to exploit more of Australia's gas resources, Orchison said.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be quite siginificant demands placed on gas producers to meet this need,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The additional gas would come from know deposits, including the Bass Straits, the Cooper Basin and the gas fields of the Timor Sea, Orchison said.</p>
<p>It was unlikely, though that a west-east pipeline linking the gas-rich fields of Western Australia with the eastern states would be built, Orchison said.  </p>
<p>&quot;That was an idea of the 1970s,&quot; he said</p>
