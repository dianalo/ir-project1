<p>A human rights group on Monday issued a scathing denunciation of plans to curb liberties in Hong Kong, saying the Beijing-backed moves could cause disorder after China takes over the British colony on July 1.</p>
<p>A proposal by Hong Kong's future leader to boost controls on organisations and demonstrations was poorly thought out, legally suspect and impractical, said Paul Harris, chairman of watchdog group Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor.</p>
<p>&quot;We think it is ridiculous; it is completely illogical... and will create complete chaos if implemented,&quot; Harris told a news conference.</p>
<p>Legal changes laid out in a consultation document by Hong Kong's future leader Tung Chee-hwa could prompt violence in the days after the territory's return to China by making legal protests almost impossible, he said.</p>
<p>China's National People's Congress, or parliament, has declared part of Hong Kong's Public Order and Societies ordinances incompatible with the Basic Law, the Beijing-drafted constitution for Hong Kong that takes effect on handover day.</p>
<p>The congress resolved to alter a string of laws protecting Hong Kong's civil and political liberties after more than 150 years of British colonial rule come to an end at midnight on June 30.</p>
<p>Hong Kong lawyers and pro-democracy activists have condemned plans by Tung that would ban groups involved in politics from taking foreign donations and would require advance police permission for public demonstrations.</p>
<p>Tung had said the curbs on protests were needed to keep the peace. But Harris said they would actually boost the risk of disorder by making organisation more difficult.</p>
<p>Protests would also be impossible from July 4-9 unless approved at least three days before the end of British rule, meaning that if residents wanted to demonstrate about any aspect of the handover they would be forced to act illegally, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;That situation could lead to very serious disorder...you will then have an illegal demonstration that the police will be asked to break up by force, and then you will have violence.&quot;</p>
<p>Part of the changes to the law on societies appeared to have been mindlessly copied from anti-treason laws in the United States and went even further than limits on foreign funding on the communist-ruled Chinese mainland, Harris said.</p>
<p>&quot;They are shot through with completely absurd drafting and proposals that would create ludicrous situations,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Hong Kong could already ban groups that threatened its security and did not need more draconian powers, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;We say: 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it'.&quot;</p>
<p>Tung has said he has no wish to change Hong Kong's tradition of tolerance of differing viewpoints and has stressed that the proposed curbs are open for public consultation until April 30.</p>
<p>But Harris said the lack of any alternative proposals and a consultation period of just three weeks raised concerns about the flexibility of former shipping magnate Tung and his aides, who have appealed for more public support of their plans.</p>
<p>Staff at the South China Morning Post newspaper said they had received more than 30 declarations of support for Tung's plans, many of them from little-known social groups, prompting concerns that Tung would take them as a mandate for his plans.</p>
