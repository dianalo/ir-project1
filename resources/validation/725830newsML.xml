<p>Asian naphtha extended its rally on Monday amid a squeeze on prompt barrels but players were cautious the rise would continue because of fears about fresh exports from the Gulf and a possible re-opening of the East-West arbitrage, traders said.</p>
<p>Traders said higher crude helped prices higher. August Brent rose 13 cents on Friday in London and had gained a further 18 cents to last trade at $18.27 on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is strong right now because the Thai's have bought most of the available prompt cargoes around but its not clear if this trend will continue,&quot; a trader said.  </p>
<p>Firmer prices were helped by short covering of prompt cargoes by some traders, which included an early August cargo at $1.00 per barrel above spot Singapore quotes on free-on-board basis, traders said.</p>
<p>Traders said most of the available arbitrage cargoes from the Mediterranean were already sold to Thailand but surplus cargoes from the Gulf remained for August lifting.</p>
<p>&quot;If all the surplus AG (Gulf) barrels are absorbed then this market has really turned around,&quot; one trader said.  </p>
<p>Naphtha had been trading in contago over the past three months due to the large exports of arbitrage cargoes from the West which took the market a long time to digest.</p>
<p>Traders said they were concerned that if the market actually takes off, a new round of arbitrage might be triggered leaving them back at square one.</p>
<p>&quot;We need the West to pick up as well for prices to increase all round,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>The current strength was clearly seen in the last Indian naphtha sale tender awards which traders said worked back to around $10 per tonne above the previous award.  </p>
<p>India sold 25,000 tonnes of low aromatic naphtha at $33.75 per tonne discount to spot U.S. Gulf 87 octane gasoline quotes on a free-on-board Bombay July 20-22 lifting.</p>
<p>It also sold 27,000 tonnes of high aromatic naphtha at $32.80 per tonne discount to spot U.S. Gulf 87 octane gasoline quotes on a free-on-board Madras July 24-26 lifting.</p>
<p>Both cargoes were sold to Swiss trader Glencore, traders said.</p>
<p>Gasoline also edged up in line with the firmer crude market with fundamentals seen unchanged.  </p>
<p>Traders said the Saudi Aramco tender to sell 32,000 to 35,000 tonnes of 98-octane unleaded reformate at around $4.20 per barrel above spot Singapore naphtha quotes on a free-on-board basis.</p>
<p>The cargo is for July 26-28 lifting from Jubail on the Red Sea.</p>
