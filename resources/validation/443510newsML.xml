<p>A sharp fall in U.S. stocks and bonds, coupled with recent warnings from the U.S. central bank chief, has raised the spectre of a serious slide for financial markets across the world.</p>
<p>But most strategists remain confident that key markets will end the year in good shape.</p>
<p>The golden rule for tightly-knit global markets is that when U.S. markets sneeze, the rest quickly catch cold. On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average of leading U.S. shares plunged 160 points after news of robust retail sales growth sparked inflationary fears.</p>
<p>U.S. Treasury bonds dropped to their lowest level in almost six months for the same reason.</p>
<p>Add to that warnings from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan -- made first in November and reaffirmed two weeks ago -- of &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; in the stock markets and you have a perfect recipe for serious market jitters.</p>
<p>But Michael Hughes, global strategist at investment bank BZW, said the party was not over yet. &quot;I don't think the bull market is over and I don't think it will be over until markets and economies are competing for savings,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The U.S. stock market has attracted a tidal wave of individuals' savings, reinvested by mutual funds.</p>
<p>Even though the Dow has rocketed from about 4,000 to 7,000 points in the last two years, there is little sign yet of that flood of cash drying up, analysts said.</p>
<p>Crunch time could come on March 25, the next time the Fed's policy-making arm -- the Federal Open Market Committee -- meets to discuss monetary policy and possible interest rate changes.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has begun to believe rates will go up on March 25 but the objective of the Fed is to keep the economic recovery on the road, not to put it into reverse,&quot; Hughes said.</p>
<p>That only requires a small rise in interest rates, he said. As things stand, a 160-point fall in the Dow, from dizzy heights above 7,000, scarcely represents a correction, let alone anything more serious.</p>
<p>And the situation looked fairly settled anyway on Friday with the FTSE-100 index of leading British shares only slightly lower, while the German DAX share index and German and British government bond futures were barely changed.</p>
<p>Karl Haeling, director of futures and options at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Futures and Options in Frankfurt, said there was little or no chance of a serious market downturn even though U.S. rates will head higher.</p>
<p>He said German markets would probably outperform as doubts about a single European currency starting on time hit markets such as Italy and Spain.</p>
<p>Steven Major, head of bond research at Credit Lyonnais, made it a trio of analysts expecting a U.S. rate rise this month.</p>
<p>But he said pessimism about European economic and monetary union (EMU) being delayed was now overdone and tipped Italian and Spanish bonds, Europe's high yielders as they used to be known.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has shifted from very EMU positive to neutral or negative.&quot; He said a 1999 start for EMU was a 50/50 bet. &quot;But even if countries like Italy do not make it first time around, their old inflation habits are long gone.&quot;</p>
<p>Italian 10-year BTP bonds yield 200 basis points (two percentage points) more than German Bunds with consumer price inflation now only 2.4 percent year-on-year. Two years ago BTPs traded six percentage points over Bunds but then inflation was above six percent.</p>
<p>The only thing that could really shake stocks and bonds is a sharp increase in U.S. rates and few analysts predict that. But in the near term, shares could be a little more vulnerable than bonds.</p>
<p>&quot;A rate rise could hit the stock market a little harder than bonds, simply because the bond market is well off its highs and the stock market is closer to its high,&quot; Haeling said.</p>
<p>The June U.S. T-bond future settled at 108-15 on Thursday, well below its peak of 115-16, charted last December. The Dow Jones meanwhile, ended at 6,879, below its all-time peak of 7,112 set on Tuesday.</p>
