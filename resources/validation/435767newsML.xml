<p>IPE Brent crude oil futures dipped through $19 a barrel after a bearish set of U.S. stocks data knocked out initial support around $20 on NYMEX crude.</p>
<p>But both contracts were boosted by technical buying after NYMEX crude found support around the $19.86-88 a barrel level.</p>
<p>Good support was expected around $20 a barrel, but this was quickly swept away after hefty a build in U.S. crude stocks last week triggered selling on crude at the NYMEX open, traders said.</p>
<p>April Brent dipped around 17 cents in sympathy to a new intra-day low at $18.90 a barrel in early NYMEX trade, but stood around seven cents down at $19.17 by 1511 GMT.  </p>
<p>U.S. crude oil stocks for the week ended March 7 rose by 6.84 million barrels to 304.62 million barrels, the American Petroleum Institute said in its weekly report.</p>
<p>Analysts see the next key support level for April Brent around $18.68 a barrel, the lowest point of the year.</p>
<p>Despite the quick turn around the longer-term bear trend is seen remaining intact with the recent upswing seen as little more than a correction to the sharp losses so far this year.</p>
<p>April gas oil futures largely ignored the volatility in crude and stood unchanged at $165.25 a tonne in the middle of the day's trading range.</p>
<p>The API report showed a build of 197,000 barrels in U.S. distillate stocks, but this was countered in Europe by recent heavy sales to the Far East.</p>
<p>In excess of 500,000 tonnes of gas oil has moved from Europe to the Far East and South America recently. Spot market traders said this had supported differentials for physical oil over IPE gas oil.</p>
