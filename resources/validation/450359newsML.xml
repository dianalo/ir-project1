<headline>U.S. homebuilding surged in February.</headline>

<p>Builders broke ground on new homes and apartments at the fastest clip in nearly three years in February, the Commerce Department said Tuesday, aided by fairer weather and a strong economy.</p>
<p>Housing starts jumped 12.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.53 million -- the strongest building pace since 1.56 million in March 1994 -- after a slight 0.7 percent gain in January and a 9 percent drop in December.</p>
<p>Severe weather at the start of winter put a crimp in building during December and January but activity snapped back in surprisingly brisk fashion last month.</p>
<p>&quot;Even adjusting for seasonal flukiness, the housing sector is doing extremely well,&quot; said economist David Wyss of DRI/McGraw Hill Inc. in Lexington, Mass., noting that stronger permit applications also suggested underlying strength.</p>
<p>Actual starts on new homes in February totalled 93,000, up from 81,300 in January but seasonal adjustment by Commerce brought that up to an annual rate of 1.53 million last month.</p>
<p>Analysts said that even if Federal Reserve policy-makers boost short-term interest rates next Tuesday, homebuilding appears likely to slow only modestly from last year's 1.48 million total.</p>
<p>&quot;The bottom line is the housing market still has plenty of momentum,&quot; said economist Mark Vitner of First Union Corp. in Charlotte, N.C. &quot;A modest rise in interest rates might temper this strength but it will not reverse it.&quot;</p>
<p>The Fed, the nation's central bank, will be weighing whether to raise interest rates for the first time in more than two years. While price rises remain muted, Fed policy-makers have expressed concern about potential pressure for wage rises because labour markets are tight across the country.</p>
<p>Wyss said that he thought a Fed rate rise was more likely to come in May than next week.</p>
<p>Regardless of its timing, a small increase in rates is unlikely to dampen housing activity, he said, since the economy was growing and jobs are being created.</p>
<p>&quot;The real question is how much would that hold housing up and the answer is I don't think it'll affect it that much,&quot; Wyss said, adding he expects starts for the full year 1997 to ease down modestly to about 1.4 million.</p>
<p>With the spring building season near and the economy now entering its seventh year of expansion, prospects appear favourable for homebuilding and sales.</p>
<p>On Monday, the National Association of Home Builders said its index of market activity rose for March on rising single-family home sales and increased visits by prospective buyers to model-home sites.</p>
<p>&quot;All the market conditions are ripe for home buying,&quot; said Kent Colton, executive vice president of the builders' lobby group. &quot;We've had a mild winter, a strong economy and relatively favourable interest rates.&quot;</p>
<p>The housing report confirmed strength in building industries signalled when the Labour Department reported earlier this month a big gain of 109,000 construction jobs in February.</p>
<p>In addition, permit applications gained 3 percent in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.44 million, a sign that builders intend to maintain a strong pace.</p>
<p>Construction starts on single-family homes climbed 8.8 percent in February after rising 9.1 percent in January. Starts on apartments jumped 27.8 percent following a 25.5 percent drop in January.</p>
<p>Mortgage rates eased slightly in February from January. The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. said rates for a 30-year loan averaged 7.65 percent in February, down from 7.82 percent in January.</p>
<p>Rates have climbed since then but remain under 8 percent.</p>
<p>The only region where starts fell during February was the Northeast, down 26.9 percent.</p>
<p>Starts soared 51.6 percent in the Midwest, rose 10.9 percent in the South and increased 5 percent in the West.</p>
