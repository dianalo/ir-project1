<p>More than 11 tonnes of ore from the controversial Busang gold property in Indonesia's Kalimantan province were flown under tight security to Australia on Tuesday for tests to determine the size of the deposit.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the Busang partners said the samples were placed in a 20-ft (6.1-metre) container and flown to Perth, escorted by a security team hired from London by Canadian mining consultant Strathcona Mineral Services, which did the drilling.</p>
<p>&quot;Representatives from the Indonesian government, Freeport, Bre-X and Nusamba left in another plane,&quot; spokeswoman Nia Sarinastiti told Reuters in Jakarta.</p>
<p>She was speaking on behalf of the Busang Indonesian Gold JV consortium formed in February to develop the Busang goldfield.</p>
<p>Canada's Bre-X Minerals Ltd has a 45-percent stake in Busang, Freeport McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc of the United States has 15 percent, the Indonesian government 10 percent and the Nusamba Group and its local partner the rest.</p>
<p>Bre-X shocked the mining community last month by admitting that there was a possibility the amount of gold at the Busang property had been overstated.</p>
<p>It had earlier put gold reserves at 70.95 million ounces, which would have made it the biggest find of the century.</p>
<p>Bre-X hired the Toronto-based Strathcona to carry out an independent audit to determine the amount of gold at Busang.</p>
<p>Sarinastiti said the ore samples were guarded by members of the Indonesian army's crack Kopassus special forces when they were kept at a locked hangar in the East Kalimantan town of Balikpapan awaiting the journey to Perth.</p>
<p>She said the samples, weighing 11,795 kg, would be crushed at an undisclosed laboratory in Perth.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of the samples will then be sent to a laboratory in Vancouver and the Indo Assay lab in Balikpapan,&quot; she said. &quot;I don't know the names of the laboratories in Canada and Perth.&quot;</p>
<p>She did not mention earlier plans of sending some of the samples to a Singapore laboratory but said she expected the results of the tests to be known in early May.</p>
<p>She said two of the drillings by the Toronto-based Strathcona was done near drilling carried out by Bre-X, two more near those done by Freeport and the remaining two sites were independently picked by Strathcona.</p>
<p>&quot;Three of the drillings were 250 metres (820 ft) deep, one was 200 metres (670 ft) and the two others 275 metres (900 ft) deep,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The Nusamba Group, headed by Indonesian tycoon Muhammad &quot;Bob&quot; Hasan, is 80-percent owned by three foundations chaired by President Suharto. Hasan and Suharto's eldest son Sigit Harjojudanto each has a 10 percent stake.</p>
<p>Mines and Energy Minister Ida Bagus Sudjana said Suharto had delayed approving two applications for contracts of work (COW) by Bre-X to further explore and develop Busang.</p>
<p>Local newspapers on Tuesday quoted Sudjana as saying Suharto would not make a decision on the applications until the results of the independent audit of Busang were known.</p>
<p>&quot;If the results are good, we can include them in the sixth generation contracts of work,&quot; the Kompas newspaper quoted Sudjana as telling reporters on Monday.</p>
<p>Sudjana confirmed Suharto had approved 68 sixth generation contracts and they would be issued soon.</p>
