<p>An Italian engineer kidnapped while working on an oil pipeline project in Colombia was released on Wednesday after five months in captivity, his employer said.</p>
<p>Italian oil and gas exploration company Saipem said an anonymous phone caller to the Italian embassy in Bogota on Wednesday reported that Lino Chioccioli, 49, had been freed.</p>
<p>Saipem said a company helicopter was dispatched to the airport at Remedios, north of the capital, and he was returned to Bogota. It did not release any details on his condition.</p>
<p>Chioccioli was kidnapped last August after he landed by helicopter at a construction site close to the Caribbean coast.</p>
<p>Saipem thanked Italy's foreign ministry and religious and humanitarian groups which helped in efforts to secure Chioccioli's release.</p>
<p>His daughter, Deborah, interviewed by the Italian news agency ANSA at her home in Arezzo, central Italy, said she did not want to discuss negotiations which resulted in his release.</p>
<p>&quot;We are happy but we don't want to say anything else. It's logical that there were negotiations...Maybe we will recount them in a few days,&quot; she was quoted as saying.</p>
