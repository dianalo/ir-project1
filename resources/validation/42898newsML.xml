<p>Highlights of matches played in the UEFA Cup first round first leg on Tuesday:</p>
<p>Germany's Schalke made a spirited return to European football after a 19-year absence, trouncing last season's Dutch championship runners-up Roda JC Kerkrade 3-0 before 50,000 fans.</p>
<p>Belgian international striker Marc Wilmots, declared fit only a hour before the game, gave Schalke the perfect start with an eighth-minute headed goal, then set up the second for Dutch international Youri Mulder six minutes later.</p>
<p>Schalke lost momentum when Mulder had to go off in the 34th minute with a gash in his knee. But midfielder Ingo Anderbruegge sealed a deserved win in the 73rd minute when his drive from 25 metres took a deflection past Kerkrade goalkeeper Ruud Hesp.</p>
<p>&quot;If anything happens to us in the second leg now, we'll have only ourselves to blame,&quot; Schalke coach Joerg Berger said.  </p>
<p>Feyenoord's midfield signing Kees van Wonderen brought the Dutch side belated joy after a scrappy game against CSKA Moscow.</p>
<p>Latching on to a through-ball from Swedish international Henke Larsson which caught the Russian defence cold in the 83rd minute, he slotted home confidently from the edge of the area to ensure a 1-0 lead going into the home leg in Rotterdam.</p>
<p>On a bad night for the Russian capital, the rain helped Dynamo Tbilisi sink Torpedo Moscow. There was little power in Gocha Dzhamarauli 37th-minute free-kick but Torpedo keeper Vladimir Pchelnikov let the wet ball slither under his body to give Georgia's 1981 Cup Winners' Cup champions a 1-0 away win.</p>
<p>There was better news for Russians in the Caucasus, where league leaders Alania Vladikavkaz put last month's 7-0 European Cup thrashing by Glasgow Rangers behind them and beat Anderlecht 2-1 after recovering from a fifth-minute strike by Par Zetterberg.</p>
<p>- - - -  </p>
<p>Belgians Ekeren scored three times after the break to secure a 3-1 first-leg cushion against Austrians Casino Graz, who were reduced to 10 shortly after the break.</p>
<p>Graz opened the scoring after eight minutes through Strafner and kept Ekeren in check until the Austrians' Serb Dimitrovic was sent off in the 49th minute.</p>
<p>The home team equalised seven minutes later through Tomasz Radzinski and Belgian international goalkeeper Philippe Vande Walle made it 2-0 from the penalty spot in the 58th before veteran striker Alex Czerniatynski netted the third six minutes from time.</p>
<p>- - - -  </p>
<p>Belgian champions Club Brugge left the pitch to jeers and whistles after a colourless performance against Denmark's Lyngby which ended in a 1-1 draw.</p>
<p>Brugge fans further humiliated their side by giving the unfancied visitors a standing ovation.</p>
<p>Club Brugge, playing in the UEFA Cup after losing to Romanians Steaua Bucharest in the qualifying round of the European Cup last month, took the lead in the second minute through midfielder Lorenzo Staelens but Anders Bjerre equalised from a free kick in the 35th.  </p>
<p>Tirol Innsbruck dominated their match against Metz of France but most scoring chances landed in the safe arms of Metz goalkeeper Lionel Letizi.</p>
<p>Letizi foiled an effort by Innsbruck's Christian Mayrleb in the 22nd minute, gathering a shot from the edge of the box.</p>
<p>Two minutes later, Letizi did well to tip a header from Michael Baur over the bar.</p>
<p>Despite increased pressure in the second half, the Austrians could not finish and in the 52nd minute Richard Kitzbichler successfully dribbled past the French defence but his thundering shot soared high.  </p>
<p>Karsten Baron and substitute Markus Schupp scored for Hamburg to give the Germans a 2-0 advantage to take home for the second leg of their clash with Scotland's Glasgow Celtic.</p>
<p>Bernd Hollerbach swung over a cross from the left to pick out the unmarked Baron at the back post in the third minute and Baron powered a header past Gordon Marshall.</p>
<p>Hamburg replaced Valdas Ivanauskas in the 65th minute with Schupp and six minutes later the substitute delivered a hammer blow to Celtic. He looked well offside but calmly strode on to loft the ball over Marshall.</p>

<p>Swedish part-timers Helsingborg secured a fine 1-1 draw against England's Aston Villa with a shock equaliser 10 minutes from time.</p>
<p>Peter Wibran silenced the 25,000 crowd with a close-range effort after Helsingborg had been content to soak up almost constant Villa pressure.</p>
<p>Tommy Johnson celebrated his recall to the Villa starting line-up by scoring the home side's goal in the 14th minute.</p>
<p>Villa lacked the imagination to break down Helsingborg, who made life difficult for the former European Cup champions by often placing 10 players behind the ball and relying on the odd counter-attack.  </p>
<p>Manager Kevin Keegan's decision to draft in Faustino Asprilla and play with just three at the back paid off handsomely as England's Newcastle beat Swedish part-timers Halmstads 4-0.</p>
<p>French winger David Ginola tormented the Halmstads defenders, making three of the goals.</p>
<p>Once Les Ferdinand had shown the way to goal after just six minutes, it was always plain sailing, with Asprilla blasting home the goal of the night before the interval.</p>
<p>Two more strikes followed at the start of the second half, one from Philippe Albert and the other from Peter Beardsley who showed his impish genius with the deftest of chips.</p>
<p>Alan Shearer, who hit the post and had two close offside decisions go against him, was unlucky not to get on the scoresheet.  </p>
<p>Two goals from Uruguay's Daniel Fonseca helped Roma compile a commanding 3-0 first leg lead over Russian visitors Dynamo Moscow, who ended the game with 10 men.</p>
<p>All three Roma goals came in a dominating first half performance and Dynamo's miserable evening was compounded early in the second half when player Sergei Shtanyuk was sent off for a second bookable offence in the 53rd minute.</p>
<p>Damiano Tommasi gave Roma to their first goal in the seventh minute when a miscued kick by Damiano Tommasi from well outside the area curved over stranded keeper Andrei Smetanin into the far corner of the net. Uruguayan Daniel Fonseca added two more, the second from the penalty spot.</p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>Enrico Chiesa scored twice to give Italians Parma a 2-1 edge over Portugal's Vitoria Guimaraes in an ill-tempered encounter in which six Guimaraes players were booked and one sent off.</p>
<p>Parma, 1995 UEFA Cup champions, broke the deadlock in the 40th minute thanks to a powerful Chiesa shot from outside the area. Guimaraes struck back in the 77th minute with a header from Gilmar but Chiesa scored his second five minutes later with a replica of the first.</p>
<p>In the final minute, Guimaraes's Toninho was sent off for dragging down Dino Baggio just as the Italian was on the verge of breaking free into area. Italian international Antonio Benarrivo suffered a suspected broken shoulder when he was fouled early in the first half.</p>
