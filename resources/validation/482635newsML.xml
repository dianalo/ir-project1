<p>GPU Energy said Wednesday it has targeted spending of $1 billion to buy out or buy down Pennsylvania independent power producer contracts.</p>
<p>The company said it has issued a request for proposals to selected operating non-utility generation projects supplying power to Metropolitan Edison Co and Pennsylvania Electric Co for bids to reduce the cost of power from the projects.</p>
<p>GPU Energy is the trade name for Met-Ed, Penelec and Jersey Central Power &amp; Light, the energy service and delivery units of GPU Inc.  GPU Energy said the $1 billion figure could be adjusted based on the quality of the proposals received.  </p>
<p>It said the proposals will be judged according to their ability to significantly reduce the long-term cost of purchases under existing contracts in a manner that is cost-effective to GPU Energy's customers.</p>
<p>Funding for the winning bids will be raised through securitization -- the issuance of transition bonds -- as established in the Commonwealth's recently enacted electric competition law, the utility said.  </p>
<p>&quot;The goal of the effort is to reduce the adverse long-term impact of these contracts, which contain power prices that are significantly above market level, on the customers of Met-Ed and Penelec,&quot; said Charles A. Mascari, vice president-power services for GPU Energy.</p>
<p>&quot;In the so-called reverse auction, we are seeking competitive proposals for buyouts, buydowns and/or restructurings of the power-purchase agreements for these NUG (non-utility generator) projects, in return for cash payments from GPU Energy,&quot; Mascari explained.  </p>
<p>GPU Energy said it recently briefed the state Public Utility Commission on its plans.</p>
<p>Mascari said the reverse auction is a limited solicitation. Only selected operating power producer's under contract with GPU Energy to supply 500 kilowatts or more of capacity and/or energy are eligible to participate as bidders.</p>
<p>The company said its proposal went to 24 projects.</p>
<p>The offer is designed to encourage broad participation and creative responses, Mascari said, allowing maximum flexibility for proposals tailored to an NUG project's specific circumstances.  </p>
<p>&quot;Buyouts of contracts are GPU Energy's primary interest,&quot; he said. &quot;But contract buydowns that reflect a reduction of price, term or committed capacity (or a combination of them) will also be of interest.</p>
<p>&quot;Contract restructurings that include provisions for GPU Energy to dispatch the plant or other approaches will be considered, but proposals requiring us to purchase operating NUG assets are not being encouraged.&quot;</p>
<p>A pre-bid meeting will be held April 22, with bids due June 2, the company said. Winning bidders are expected to be notified by August 15.</p>
<p>It said the signing of contracts with the winning bidders is targeted to occur by the end of the year, and payments to them are scheduled to take place in the first half of 1998.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, GPU Energy noted, it has bought out or restructured five unbuilt power projects.</p>
