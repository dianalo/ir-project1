<p>Russia's Norilsk Nickel NKEL.RTS said on Friday it hoped to avoid issuing new shares to raise cash to pay off its federal debts by instead cutting a mutual forgiveness deal with the government.</p>
<p>&quot;If possible, we will restructure our debts with the help of mutual debt forgiveness, without collateral,&quot; First Deputy Chief Executive Dmitry Zelenin said.</p>
<p>He said the state, through the Gokhran strategic metals reserve, owed nearly as much to Norilsk as did Norilsk to the federal government.</p>
<p>&quot;A decision on issuing shares has been taken, but it is more likely that there won't be an issue and NGMK's debt to the budget will be restructured with the help of mutual debt forgiveness,&quot; said RAO Norilsky Nikel's chief executive, Alexander Khloponin.</p>
<p>Norilsk's flagship plant, the Norilsk mining and metallurgical complex, is part of the RAO Norilsk Nickel group.</p>
<p>Khloponin said Gokhran owed Norilsk 800 billion roubles ($138.9 million) for precious metals deliveries while Norilsk owed the government 600 billion roubles in overdue taxes.</p>
<p>Zelenin said a government commission would meet on Monday to make a final decision on how to restructure the company's debt.</p>
<p>The government has given indebted enterprises the option of restructuring their debts to the state. The scheme would involve companies transferring a majority stake to the state in return for payment rescheduling.</p>
<p>If a company defaulted on an agreed payment schedule, the government would retain the stake.</p>
<p>Norilsk's flagship plant has considered doubling its charter capital by issuing about 11 million ordinary shares with a face value of 1,000 roubles. The shares would be handed to the government as collateral.</p>
