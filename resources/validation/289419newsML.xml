<title>BELGIUM: Belgian OLOs rangebound, Morgan switches benchmark.</title>
<headline>Belgian OLOs rangebound, Morgan switches benchmark.</headline>
<dateline>BRUSSELS 1997-01-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Belgian linear bonds ended a rangebound day little changed, with most talk in the market focused on the decision of primary dealer J.P. Morgan  MEUR to start quoting a series of new benchmarks.</p>
<p>The overall trend was weaker, but dealers did not expect prices to move much until the week's first heavy economic data is released on Thursday and Friday.</p>
<p>The current benchmark 10-year OLO 24 (7.00 pct, May 2006) yield was at 6.07 percent in late trade, up from 6.06 percent on Friday, 10 bps over Bunds. The new benchmark OLO 26 (6.25 pct, March 2007) yield was 6.18 percent, 22 bps over Bunds.  </p>
<p>J.P. Morgan indicated mid-session it would start using OLO 26 as the new Belgian 10-year benchmark. It also decided to switch to using OLO 13 (7.00 pct, April 1999) and OLO 7 (9.00 pct, June 2001) as its new two- and five-year benchmarks respectively.</p>
<p>&quot;One or two other primary dealers have followed but the domestics are not yet interested,&quot; commented a trader at a domestic bank.</p>
<p>He said OLO 26, although earmarked for supply by the Treasury, was the market's fourth smallest issue, accounting for around 86 billion francs, or 1.7 percent of total outstanding.  </p>
<p>This compared with around 274 billion outstanding in OLO 24 and 268 billion francs in OLO 9 (8.50 pct, October 2007).</p>
