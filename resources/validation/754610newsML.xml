<title>DENMARK: Final ruling on Danish EU challenge seen in March.</title>

<p>A final Supreme Court ruling on an appeal by a group of Danes challenging the legality of Denmark's European Union membership can be expected in March 1998 at the earliest, the petitioners' lawyer said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;If the appeal proceedings go without a hitch, the Supreme Court should conduct its final hearings in February or March, with a verdict expected in March at the very earliest,&quot; Ole Krarup, lawyer for the 10-member non-partisan group, said at a news conference.</p>
<p>On June 27, the Danish High Court dismissed a suit by the group, which calls itself the Constitutional Committee and claims that Denmark's membership of the European Union is unconstitutional.</p>
<p>The group says that since joining the EU in 1973, Denmark has ceded authority to the bloc's institutions in breach of its own constitution.</p>
<p>The citizens formally filed their appeal against the High Court ruling this week and their case is expected to open in the Supreme Court in October, government officials said.</p>
<p>Most analysts expect the appeal to fail, but if it succeeds the government must either renegotiate all its EU treaties or amend the constitution, both long and tortuous processes.</p>
<p>The government has said it expects to delay a referendum on the latest revisions to the EU, agreed at a June summit in Amsterdam, until the appeal verdict is delivered.</p>
<p>The centre-left coalition government believes its case is watertight and lawyers from both sides say state attorneys' task has been eased by rulings that the case should be limited to events since the 1992 Maastricht Treaty.</p>
<p>Danes, traditionally cool toward European integration, rejected the treaty outright in a 1992 referendum.</p>
<p>Voters grudgingly approved the treaty the following year on condition that Denmark opt out of economic and monetary union and joint defence, policing and asylum policies.</p>
