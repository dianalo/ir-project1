<p>It would be unimaginable to launch a European single currency without Italy, while Spain and Portugal should also be in from the start, Bank of France monetary policy council member Paul Marchelli said on Friday.</p>
<p>And if this meant the new euro turned out to be less strong than Germany wanted, it would be a good thing for Europe as it struggles to bring down high unemployment, he told Reuters in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot imagine the euro without Italy. It is impossible. It is like having Paris without the Eiffel Tower. It is ridiculous,&quot; he said. &quot;We must have Italy, Spain and Portugal.&quot;</p>
<p>Greece was not going to be ready for the launch of the single currency in 1999, but should be helped to join as quickly as possible afterwards.</p>
<p>Marchelli, who does not shun controversy, spoke of anti-south racism.</p>
<p>He said Italy had made a tremendous effort to meet criteria for entry into a single currency and its only real problem stemmed from German fears that Italian membership would weaken the new euro.</p>
<p>&quot;The Germans, who want a strong euro, in my opinion too strong a euro, tend to reject the southern countries,&quot; he said. &quot;They fear the euro will not be strong enough. It is the only real problem of the Italians.&quot;</p>
<p>But he said the future of Europe had to be built on a balance between northern and southern countries and on a recognition of the need to fight unemployment, running at postwar records in some countries.</p>
<p>An overly strong euro might push unemployment higher.</p>
<p>&quot;I want the euro to be created. I want Europe to be built. I also want people to be working in Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;If the base for EMU is wider and if the currency is less strong than (Bundesbank President Hans) Tietmeyer hopes, that would be an excellent thing,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Marchelli also said that if the government were to take public opinion into account, it would be clear that French people wanted Italy in the euro at the start.</p>
<p>He said it was narrow-minded to limit the debate on monetary union to whether it would launched on time in 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a completely secondary argument,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>And Germany, itself struggling to meet Maastricht treaty criteria, had to accept it alone could not run Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;This anti-south racism will disappear,&quot; he said.</p>
