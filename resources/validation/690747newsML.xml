<p>Booming economies and expanding television markets in Asia are fuelling double-digit growth in advertising, with key markets such as China offering vast growth opportunities, industry experts said.</p>
<p>Advertising executives told Reuters Asia's increasing importance was driven home when a 350-strong delegation arrived from China to attend this year's International Advertising Festival in the French resort town of Cannes.</p>
<p>The Chinese delegation is one of the biggest from any country at Cannes, where some 6,000 delegates arrived from 70 countries earlier this week to attend the six-day festival.</p>
<p>Tomaz Mok, the executive creative director for McCann-Erickson Guangming Ltd advertising agency in China, described how advertising was basically not allowed for decades after the communists came to power.</p>
<p>In the old days, when the Peoples Republic of China was established its 1949, advertising was not very popular, he told Reuters this week at Cannes.</p>
<p>There was no free enterprise, no market economy, no brand names, he said.</p>
<p>But that's all changing with rapid economic growth and economic liberalisation in China.</p>
<p>Mok said China now had hundreds of television channels, including some national networks.</p>
<p>Advertising expenditure in China shot up to $1.1 billion in 1996, a 34-percent increase over 1995, and that kind of growth is expected to continue, Mok said.</p>
<p>&quot;Theres a great opportunity for multinationals to communicate about their products,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Across Asia, Western-based multinationals such as Unilever Plc and Procter &amp; Gamble have driven much of the region's growth in advertising.</p>
<p>But executives at Cannes said Asian companies now played an equally important role in the growth of marketing services.</p>
<p>Advertising executives in Cannes said many Asian countries were also finding their own voice in advertising rather than just adopting Western-style ads.</p>
<p>In China, Procter &amp; Gamble is the largest advertiser, followed by Jian Li Baa, a Chinese soft-drinks company, and Qin Chi, a local wine company.</p>
<p>Delegates at Cannes told Reuters they saw huge potential for introducing new products to a population whose disposable income was growing fast, but which had been isolated from internationally-branded consumer products.</p>
<p>Geoff Thompson, worldwide creative director for Foote Cone &amp; Belding, the U.S.-based ad agency owned by True North Communications Inc, described a recent research his agency did by visiting homes in rural parts of China.</p>
<p>&quot;People have a SONY TV and a stereo, but they dont know what toothpaste is ... But they will,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Western-based multinationals such as Nestle SA, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Coca-Cola have entered China, bringing a certain Western advertising influence, but have also found they had to adapt their commercial message to Chinese tastes.</p>
<p>&quot;In general, informative advertising is very popular&quot; in China, said Mok, whose agency is linked to U.S.-based McCann-Erickson, which is owned by Interpublic Group of Companies Inc.</p>
<p>&quot;The features of a particular product make a difference, rather than the brand name,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Executives at Cannes said so-called lifestyle ads or those using Western-style humour to promote products were not very successful in China.</p>
<p>To succeed, local and foreign ad agencies must know how to cope with government restrictions in China.</p>
<p>The government in Beijing strictly regulates advertising, banning television advertising of tobacco and of alcoholic spirits.</p>
<p>There are strict regulations on how medical products can be portrayed in ads. And all forms of &quot;comparative advertising&quot;, where the advertiser's product is compared to competitors', is also banned.</p>
<p>&quot;You cant say Coke tastes better than Pepsi,&quot; Mok said. &quot;You cant even say, 'glasses are passe. Wear contact lenses instead.'&quot;</p>
<p>In more developed advertising markets in Asia, Western-based companies are learning they can only reach Asian consumers if they truly speak their language.</p>
<p>Executives at Cannes said Western-style advertising used to be considered the best by many consumers in countries like Singapore, India and Malaysia.</p>
<p>    But that's changing.    &quot;Up until about five years ago</p>
<p>advertising in Malaysia had been total Europhile, Yasmin Ahmad, executive creative director for Leo Burnett in Malaysia, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;But five to seven years ago people realised consumers (in Malaysia) didn't care about advertising trends in Europe and America, she said.</p>
<p>Japan, the world's second largest advertising market after the United States, and Thailand have their own distinctive advertising styles which don't borrow much from the West.</p>
<p>Western-style advertising still works pretty well in Singapore, Ahmad said.</p>
<p>But in Malaysia, where the advertising industry is worth an annual $1.0 billion and is growing by 18 percent a year, some consumers relate to Western-style marketing, while others want a more Malaysian-style commercial message.</p>
