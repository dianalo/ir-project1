<p>UK base rates are likely to stand at around seven percent by the end of 1997 from their current six percent level, Sir Brian Pitman, chairman of Lloyds TSB Group Plc, said on Friday.</p>
<p>Asked to comment on the path of rates at a news conference, Pitman said, &quot;The markets are predicting seven percent base rates by the end of the year and that could well turn out to be true.&quot;</p>
<p>Pitman said the current releatively stable, low inflation environment was positive for bank profits but said the longer-term picture was very difficult to predict.</p>
<p>He noted that high money supply growth in Britain seemed inconsistent with low inflation but said that price competition in the economy was intense.</p>
<p>Pitman said that a timely rise in rates should be used to pre-empt inflation and said that longer rates, in the bond market, were already responding to the fear of an upturn in inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;If the right action is taken at the right time, it's perfectly possible that we will continue to have low inflation,&quot; Pitman added.</p>
