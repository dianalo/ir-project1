<p>The ringgit remained under pressure from fund demand for the dollar throughout the session but its fall was again limited by the continued presence of Bank Negara Malaysia at 2.5250 a dollar, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Negara is still there at 2.5250,&quot; a dealer with a European bank in Singapore said, adding that local corporate selling was also capping the dollar's rise at that level.</p>
<p>News of a trade surplus in May had no impact on the market, dealers said. Malaysia posted a 156.8 million ringgit surplus for May, compared with a 2.13 billion ringgit deficit in April.</p>
<p>At 1000 GMT, the ringgit was at 2.5240/50 to a dollar.  </p>
<p>Bank Negara had aggressively defended the ringgit at 2.5250, with banking sources saying the central bank had sold around $400 million last week.</p>
<p>This has led many to &quot;punt&quot; the range, going short on approach of the 2.5250 level and covering on the occasional dips, said one dealer.</p>
<p>Dealers said the ringgit was expected to remain under pressure from offshore dollar bids with stop-loss sales seen above the 2.5270 level.</p>
<p>They said speculators were waiting to buy any dips to 2.5240 and below. Having obtained ringgit funds from long swap positions, speculators are not worried about any Bank Negara-engineered squeeze on liquidity as they do not need to fund their positions, dealers said.</p>
<p>On Friday, the ringgit weakened on rumours that Bank Negara would be holding meetings with local bank heads to discuss some possible restriction on ringgit lending to offshore players.</p>
<p>But banking sources said there was no such meeting.</p>
