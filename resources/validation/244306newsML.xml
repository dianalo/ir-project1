<p>Turkish Finance Minister Abdullatif Sener said on Monday the government aimed to reduce the interest burden to 29.8 percent of public spending in 1997 from 38.2 percent currently.</p>
<p>&quot;Borrowing squeezed in short-term maturities and at high interest rates seen in public finance has led to state dominance in money and capital markets and is making borrowing in the private sector impossible,&quot; Sener said in a speech at the start of a parliament debate on the 1997 draft budget.</p>
<p>&quot;The 1997 budget aims to change this negative trend and to reduce total interest repayments to 29.8 percent of the total budget spending from 38.2 percent,&quot; Sener said.</p>
<p>Progress in the government's privatisation programme, including the sale of Turk Telekom and mobile telephone (GSM) service licences, will contribute to an increase in non-tax government income in 1997, he said.</p>
<p>The 6,255 trillion lira 1997 budget targets a zero deficit, with 69.8 percent of revenues coming from tax.</p>
<p>Sener forecast that gross national product (GNP) would grow around seven percent in 1996, with the agriculture sector expected to grow 2.8 percent, the industrial sector 6.9 percent and the services sector 8.8 percent.</p>
<p>Public sector investments are likely to amount to 4.6 percent of GNP in 1996, he said.</p>
<p>Exports in 1996 are likely to rise 13.2 percent from 1995 to $24.5 billion, while imports are expected to increase 26 percent to $45 billion, he said.</p>
<p>The foreign trade balance was expected to show a $20.5 billion deficit and the current account a $6.9 billion deficit in 1996. Last year, Turkey's foreign trade deficit was $14.1 billion and the current account deficit was $2.34 bilion.</p>
