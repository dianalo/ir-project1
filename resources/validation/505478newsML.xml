<p>Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi, feted with a hero's welcome in Albania, said on Sunday that a multinational security force could aid the country's &quot;rebirth&quot; after weeks of armed anarchy.</p>
<p>More than 10,000 cheering Albanians greeted Prodi in the rebel-held southern port city of Vlore, birthplace of a violent uprising that has claimed nearly 300 lives.</p>
<p>Prodi said the 6,000 troops in a U.N.-backed force that will deploy en masse on Tuesday could help Europe's poorest nation restore law and order. Italy is leading the mission, which it has codenamed &quot;Alba&quot;, or &quot;dawn&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The mission is called 'Alba',&quot; Prodi said. &quot;And this could be the dawn in the history of Albania, the rebirth of Albania.&quot;</p>
<p>The eight-nation force will arrive at the western port of Durres to protect shipments of emergency food aid and medicine. About 100 Italian troops arrived on Friday and an advance French unit reached Albania on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;Italy wants to help Albania to reconstruct the state and to have quick democratic, transparent elections,&quot; Prodi told a news conference in Tirana with Prime Minister Bashkim Fino.</p>
<p>But he added: &quot;I don't want to interfere in internal Albanian policy...We are not here to...make the situation worse.&quot;</p>
<p>Escorted by heavily-armed Italian marines, Prodi first went by helicopter to Vlore, where he expressed his condolences after a boat disaster last month in which more than 80 Albanian refugees drowned.</p>
<p>Worries about anti-Italian sentiment in the region, scene of much of the violence that flared after the collapse of get-rich-quick savings schemes, soon evaporated as Prodi landed.</p>
<p>Thousands lined the road leading into town and cheered as he passed by in a motorcade of about 30 cars and armoured vehicles. Banners reading &quot;Welcome Mr Prodi&quot; along with &quot;We Want Our Money Back&quot; were held up by spectators along the road into town.</p>
<p>An estimated 10,000 cheering people jammed a central town square in front of a university building where Prodi and Fino met local leaders in the rebel stronghold.</p>
<p>Vlore has been a focal point of the unrest, with 135 people killed and 537 wounded. Kalashnikov rifles were visible everywhere and security for Prodi was extremely tight.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a privilege to have Prime Minister Prodi here in our city,&quot; said Albert Shyti, the leader of Vlore's national salvation committee, or rebel-held town council.</p>
<p>Outside the meeting, the crowd also chanted profanities in Italian deriding President Sali Berisha, whom many southern Albanians blame for the chaos sweeping the nation. Prodi met Berisha in Tirana later on Sunday.</p>
<p>Advance Italian troops have arrived to make preparations for the main force, which will include soldiers from France, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Austria, Denmark and Romania.</p>
<p>Some 3,500 Albanian troops, including commandos and tank brigades, will help the multinational mission, officials said.</p>
<p>Forty French soldiers from the ship Chamberlain disembarked in Durres after sailing across the Adriatic from the Italian port of Brindisi. An Italian amphibious assault ship with about 600 men on board set sail for Albania on Sunday.</p>
<p>A U.N. relief official in Tirana said the first shipment of 400 tonnes of flour and beans was due in Durres on Tuesday and will be distributed to isolated villages even if the security forces are not yet in place to protect the convoys.</p>
<p>&quot;We are here to cope with an emergency,&quot; said United Nations World Food Programme spokeswoman Laura Boldrini. &quot;We have to go ahead. There are very needy people there and we cannot wait any longer.&quot;</p>
