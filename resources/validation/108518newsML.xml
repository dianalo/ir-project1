<p>Bundesbank council member Ernst Welteke on Thursday agreed that there was some leeway on the interpretation of the budget criteria for entry to Europe's single currency but said this was no excuse for fiscal laxity.</p>
<p>In a speech to explain Europe's planned monetary union to the public, he said limits of three and 60 percent laid down in the Maastricht Treaty as a measure of deficits and debt to total output were not the sole deciding factors for qualification for EMU.</p>
<p>&quot;In contrast to the view often expressed, the three percent deficit and 60 percent debt limit are not definitive entry criteria for monetary union,&quot; he said, adding that these were simply a measure of progress toward long-term budget control.</p>
<p>A text of his speech was released in advance of delivery to a group of over 800 people in the small town of Korbach, in the northern part of the state of Hesse.</p>
<p>Welteke's comments come amid a Bundesbank campaign to emphasise to would-be EMU participants that it is not enough to simply meet the fiscal criteria on a one-off basis in 1997, the crunch year for the decision on who passes the EMU test.</p>
<p>The central bank's concern was triggered by the plans of a growing number of countries to include extra revenues to make sure they get within the set limits on time.</p>
<p>Welteke warned that a correct result on the fiscal numbers would not necessarily be enough when the council of European leaders met to decide which nations could enter monetary union.</p>
<p>&quot;The decision on whether a country has an excessive deficit ...is certainly to a large part dependent on whether the three percent or 60 percent level is achieved, but the council will reach its decision after examining the total position of a nation, in particular its ability to manage its debt position,&quot; Welteke said.</p>
<p>The Maastricht Treaty on European and Monetary Union calls for countries which wish to meld their currencies in the Euro to meet targets on exchange rates, interest rates and inflation in addition to the two fiscal criteria.</p>
<p>Most countries are facing problems on their budget goals.</p>
<p>German citizens, nervous of surrendering their cherished marks in return for an unknown European currency, and encouraged by the rhetoric of political and financial officials generally tend to view the two budget limits as absolute essential qualifications for entering monetary union.</p>
<p>However the Treaty itself allows some room for flexibility in deciding who has made the grade on the fiscal side, allowing trends and extreme economic problems to be taken into account.</p>
<p>Welteke made clear in his remarks that it was important to be aware that this flexibility existed.</p>
<p>&quot;Insisting on an exact fulfilment of the entry criteria could lead to irritation in the general public if a country is allowed to take part (in EMU) even though it has, for example, exceeded the 60 percent mark,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But Welteke also made clear that his remarks should not be taken as an excuse to slacken off on fiscal consolidation.</p>
<p>He added that it was essential that a long-term mechanism be found to ensure fiscal discipline even after the launch of a single currency and welcomed the fact European finance ministers had reached basic agreement on a &quot;stability pact.&quot;</p>
<p>The framework of the so-called stability pact, agreed at a meeting in Dublin in late September, foresees sanctions and fines for countries which overspend.</p>
