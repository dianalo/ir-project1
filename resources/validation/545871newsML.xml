<title>USA: Senator seeks SEC review of solid waste bonds.</title>
<headline>Senator seeks SEC review of solid waste bonds.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-04-29</dateline>

<p>A key U.S. Senate panel chairman asked the SEC to launch a review of whether localities that issued bonds to build solid waste disposal sites in recent years adequately disclosed investment risks to buyers, according to a letter released on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Recent testimony...before our Committee raised my concern that there may be a limited number of instances where some investors may not have been fully informed about the risks associated with these types of facilities,&quot; Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., chairman of the Senate subcommitte on superfund, waste control and risk assessment said.  </p>
<p>Smith said at a March 18 hearing on the controversial issue of solid waste site financing, dubbed &quot;flow control,&quot; the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee &quot;was informed of an unidentified project for which in excess of $40 million in bonds had been issued, but construction had not occurred.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This development appears to be rather unusual, and presumably would have serious financial repercussions for an issuer, including potential tax consequences,&quot; Smith said.</p>
<p>Smith was referring to charges by U.S. Rep. Bill Pascrell, a Democrat from New Jersey, at the March 18 hearing that some New Jersey counties have bonded for facilities that were never built.</p>
<p>Smith asked Levitt for a report on the quality of disclosure by municipalities to potential solid waste bond investors. Were buyers told whether a particular facility could generate enough revenue to meet debt service, he asked. Also, were potential investors told of the uncertain legal status of facilities and did investment documents discuss potential for default, Smith asked Levitt.</p>
<p>Smith said the committee has &quot;serious concerns ... that some investors may not have been provided with the legally required information about the risks associated with some of these bonds, and consequently, may have been led to believe that their investments were much more stable that they actually were.&quot;</p>
<p>Flow control refers to the ability of local governments to require that municipal solid waste generated within a jurisdication be processed at a designated disposal site. The U.S. Supreme Court in 1994 ruled that flow control policies are unconstitutional, raising major credit quality concerns about billions of dollars of outstanding solid waste facility debt nationwide.</p>
