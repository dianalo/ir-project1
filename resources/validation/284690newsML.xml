<title>AUSTRALIA: Thin Australian stocks end down as Dow drops.</title>

<p>Australian shares closed weaker but well off their lows on Thursday as a thinly-traded market greeted the New Year.</p>
<p>Despite diving 27 points early after the Dow's dip on Tuesday, strong support below the 2,400 level saw the local bourse bounce back and spend most of its day trading in a five-point range between 2,410 and 2,415.</p>
<p>The All Ordinaries index shed 13.4 points to 2411.2 after touching an intraday low of 2,397.8.</p>
<p>&quot;The Dow fall went through and then people started to pick it up again,&quot; said a dealer at a Melbourne brokerage.</p>
<p>An upbeat local tone ensured any Dow-inspired losses were minimised with the relatively strong Australian performance of the last few days continuing.</p>
<p>&quot;It has looked pretty good. The year ended well and that was quite positive even though trade has been pretty quiet.&quot; the dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no real economic news due out in the next couple of days so I think people may be just treading water,&quot; he added.</p>
