<p>Devastating fast bowling from Allan Donald helped South Africa to an eight-wicket victory over Australia in the third and final cricket test at Centurion Park on Monday.</p>
<p>Donald finished with figures of five for 36 from 18 overs, bowling four of his victims, as Australia were dismissed for 185 in their second innings, leaving South Africa needing just 29 for victory.</p>
<p>Donald had match figures of eight for 96 to earn the man-of-the-match award.</p>
<p>South Africa lost openers Adam Bacher and Gary Kirsten en route to their total before Daryll Cullinan hit the winning runs to give South Africa some consolation after losing the first two tests.</p>
<p>Australia resumed at 96 for four, still 61 runs in arrears on first innings, and could add only 89 runs before being dismissed.</p>
<p>Donald bowled Greg Blewett with a fast inswinging yorker with the first ball of the day to set the tone, with only Steve Waugh offering prolonged resistance.</p>
<p>He followed up his first innings top score of 67 with an undefeated 60 in almost four and a half hours to earn the man-of-the-series award with an aggregate of 313 runs at an average of 78.3.</p>
