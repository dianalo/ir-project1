<p>PHP Healthcare Corp said Wedenesday that it has paid $73 million to run the facilities of The Health Insurance Plan of New Jersey (HIP) until the year 2007.</p>
<p>Under terms of the 20-year deal, PHP said it will acquire the assets of HIP's 18 healthcare centers and its pharmacy and optical services, which will be integrated into PHP's Pinnacle Health Enterprises unit.</p>
<p>PHP also said it will run the healthcare services for HIP's 200,000 members through a global capitation and exclusive arrangement.</p>
<p>HIP will monitor the quality of patient care and be responsible for the development of new healthcare programs and new member recruitment.</p>
<p>Anthony Watson, HIP's chairman, said in a statement, &quot;This strategic alliance is part of HIP's corporate mission to reorganize our healthcare delivery system to meet the revolutionary, accelerating changes taking place in the highly competitive healthcare market.</p>
<p>It also represents a logical next step for HIP in our continuing mission to solidify our dominant position in the region's managed care industry.&quot;</p>
<p>The not-for-profit HIP Health Plan of New Jersey is part of the 1.2 million member HIP system with affiliates in New York, Pennsylvania, and Florida.</p>
<p>&quot;This alliance will greatly enhance health care in New Jersey, benefiting members of both the HIP and Pinnacle Health Enterprises networks,&quot; said PHP chief executive Jack Mazur in a statement. &quot;The future of health care is in developing collaborative working relationships between providers, physicians and payors.  I believe the flexibility of our network models and the quality care we provide has led to our success, and that in turn, will build shareholder value.&quot;</p>
<p>PHP, a for-profit corporation founded in 1975, currently manages more than 90 healthcare projects in 28 markets.</p>
