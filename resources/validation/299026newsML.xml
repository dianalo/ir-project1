<headline>Argentine stocks close shade higher, seen firm.</headline>
<dateline>BUENOS AIRES 1997-01-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>Argentine stocks soaked up early profit-taking and closed firm Friday, cheered by a surge on Wall Street which was not bargained for, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market followed through on its recent strength thanks to the unexpected turn of events in New York,&quot; said Miguel Daneri at Boston Securities.</p>
<p>He predicted stocks would stay firm early next week, weathering bouts of profit-taking due to a steady rise in foreign investment flows into emerging markets.</p>
<p>The blue-chip MerVal index edged up 0.4 percent to 674.93, stretching gains in the week to 3.5 percent.  </p>
<p>The MerVal has closed higher in the past five consecutive sessions and stands virtually at a three-year high.</p>
<p>&quot;Argentina's steady economic recovery and expectations surrounding bond placements in the first quarter of the year make it a good choice for emerging market fund managers who are building up new portfolios,&quot; said an analyst at a foreign investment bank.</p>
<p>Heavyweight stocks listed abroad as ADRs were the strongest performers in the session, with Telefonica and Telecom jumping 3.1 percent and 2.6 percent respectively. Banco Frances also rose 3.1 percent.  </p>
<p>Benchmark stock YPF rose 0.6 percent, taking its week-long bull run to 9.5 percent. Two other blue-chip oil firms, Sol Petroleo and Astra, gained 2.5 percent and 1.0 percent each.</p>
<p>The broad market tacked on 1.0 percent, with winners beating losers 36 to 21 and 19 issues closing flat. Heaviest main-tier losers were pulp maker Celulosa, which tumbled 5.8 percent, and carmaker Ciadea, off 1.1 percent.</p>
<p>Floor volume eased to 25 million pesos from 36.1 million Thursday, while over-the-counter deals picked up to 151.6 million from 124.8 million Thursday.</p>
