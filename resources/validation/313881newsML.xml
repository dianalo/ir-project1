<p>Jim Bolger-trained Mantovani was Ireland's champion two-year-old for 1996, according to the Irish racing classifications released on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Irish classifications said Mantovani had achieved champion two-year-old status with a win in the Group One Heinz Phoenix Stakes at Leopardstown in August.</p>
<p>Bolger said he hoped that Mantovani, rated 116, will be a serious Classic contender at a mile in 1997.</p>
<p>Dermot Weld's Irish Derby winner Zagbreb was Ireland's champion three year-old for 1996, the Irish classifications said.</p>
<p>Pat Shanahan-ridden Zagreb, rated 125, gave Weld his first triumph in Ireland's premier Classic.</p>
<p>Weld said Zagreb may reappear in the Dubai World Cup, the prestigious international event won in 1996 by American star Cigar.</p>
<p>Kevin Prendergast's Oscar Schindler and John Oxx-trained triple Group One heroine Timarida were joint champions in the older age group, the classifications said.</p>
<p>Oscar Schindler, rated 124, won the Group One Irish St.Leger and then went on to finish a creditable third to the top rated European horse in 1996, Helissio, in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.</p>
<p>In addition, Oscar Schindler was the highest rated stayer in all age groups in the 1996 international classifications.</p>
<p>Oxx's Timarida, rated 124, succeeded her former stable companion Ridgewood Pearl as the top rated filly of her generation in Europe.</p>
<p>Timarida won Group One races in three different countries, Germany, USA and Ireland (Irish Champion Stakes) in 1996.</p>
