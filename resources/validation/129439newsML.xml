<headline>Asia stocks seen taking cue from Dow, Japan polls.</headline>
<dateline>HONG KONG 1996-10-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>Asian markets are expected to continue to rise on balance in the coming week provided Wall Street remains on course, said brokers.</p>
<p>Sentiment in the region may also be guided by politics as investors await any fall-out from the Japanese elections on Sunday. The market fears further political uncertainty could hamper recovery and wants a government strong enough to take steps to underpin the economy.</p>
<p>Third quarter earnings in a number of centres will also be eyed by investors.</p>

<p>TOKYO - Tokyo stocks are seen hovering in the 21,500 to 22,000 range in the coming week, as investors hunker down to wait for the new government to cobble together policies that will help the economy, brokers said.</p>
<p>Most market participants hope that the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) will secure a majority of the seats in the Lower House of parliament elections on October 20.</p>
<p>&quot;Political leadership has been weak for the past couple of years and anything is better than the current state,&quot; Daiichi's Securities analyst Akishige Ishikura said.</p>
<p>Brokers said that institutional investors were active in the market on Friday in anticipation of the elections. They helped push the key Nikkei 225 index past two fierce resistance levels -- the end-September closing high of 21,556 and 21,603, a recent intra-day high. They said the next notch was 22,000.</p>
<p>On Friday, the benchmark ended 188.56 points or 0.88 percent higher at 21,612.30. It rose over 640 points in the course of the week. - - - -</p>
<p>HONG KONG - Hong Kong stocks are likely to continue to advance, taking their lead from the record-breaking Dow in the week ahead, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is likely to follow the Dow to a new high next week,&quot; said Francis Wu, institutional sales manager at South China Securities.</p>
<p>Hong Kong stocks powered ahead 73.25 points to a record high close of 12,510.05 on Friday. The market's strong end week run in advance of a three-day weekend and local holiday on Monday, capped a record breaking week which also saw the Hang Seng set a new intra-day high of 12,602.34 on Wednesday.</p>

<p>BANGKOK - The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index is expected to rise slightly in the coming week as investors pick up cheap priced stocks, especially banking issues, brokers said.</p>
<p>The market, however, is not expected to be active because it operates only four days next week as Wednesday is a public holiday due to King Rama V day.</p>
<p>&quot;The index is expected to rise marginally as investors await third quarter corporate earning results,&quot; said Payuha Boonsiri of Nithipat Capital.</p>
<p>The SET index closed at 948.09 points on Friday, compared with 932.86 last Friday. - - - -</p>
<p>BOMBAY - Indian shares are expected to take their cue from easier money conditions in the upcoming week, but an upsurge will be hindered by slack retail investor demand, brokers said.</p>
<p>The central bank is expected to cut cash reserve requirements for banks and put pressure on high interest rates in its monetary policy for the second half of 1996/97 (April-March) due for release on Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>The 30-share index of the Bombay Stock Exchange fell 30.31 points, or 0.96 percent, to 3,130.21 in the week to Friday.</p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>COLOMBO - Sri Lanka stocks are expected to range trade in the week ahead with the upside capped by retailers taking profit, brokers said.</p>
<p>The all share index closed at 608.04 on Friday, 16.63 points or 2.8 percent up from last week.</p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>JAKARTA - Jakarta share prices are likely to be mixed but trade should be relatively slow as many investors focused on the primary market and trading on a short-term basis, brokers said.</p>
<p>Brokers said many investors were awaiting corporate news, including third-quarter results, to improve market sentiment. They said the news could move the market either way.</p>
<p>On Friday, the Jakarta Composite Index closed at 570.20 points, against last week's close of 571.23 points. - - - -</p>
<p>KUALA LUMPUR - Analysts said they expect the strong performance of the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange to continue.</p>
<p>&quot;It (the market) should continue to be quite firm next week,&quot; said Audrey Ho, head of research at Mohaiyani Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;Retail interest should continue to be on the Second Board, but foreign funds should continue to buy selective blue-chip stocks,&quot; said Ho.</p>
<p>Analysts said they were anticipating a &quot;pro-business&quot; budget which may contain sweeteners such as a corporate tax cut.</p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>MANILA - Manila shares are seen vaulting past present levels, bolstered by the release of third quarter corporate earnings, analysts said.</p>
<p>The index soared by 126.14 points, or 4.24 percent, to 3,099.73 on Friday compared with its previous Friday close of 2,973.59 points.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is recovering. Sentiment which was cautious the first two days of rebound is slowly turning around and there is more aggressive buying,&quot; said Teresa Lee, Lippo Securities' assistant vice-president.</p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>SEOUL - Blue chips are expected to be in demand as buying comes in following the launch of a new employee stock savings programme on Monday, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;Blue chips and large cap shares are seen as relatively cheap these days because they've been so battered by fears about the economy,&quot; said Park Hae-soo of Seoul Securities. &quot;But small and medium-sized shares have risen enough for profit-taking.&quot;</p>
<p>On Friday, the composite index closed at 831.18, compared with last Friday's 830.21.</p>

<p>SINGAPORE - The Singapore stock market could see further weakness after concluding a miserable week, dealers said.</p>
<p>The island's key stockmarket barometer, the Straits Times Industrials Index, closed on Friday at 2,064.52 points, not far above an 18-month intraday low of 2045.58 touched on October 14.</p>
<p>Dealers said several large local stocks, including telephone monopoly Singapore Telecom and food group Cerebos, still looked capable of more falls, which could drag the index to new lows.</p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>SYDNEY - Dealers said sentiment for the Australian share market was still positive after the market reached record high levels last week. However, investors were likely to be cautious ahead of the release of key economic data.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is well-positioned to take advantage of any more gains by Wall Street without being too badly affected by a pull-back in that market,&quot; a Sydney-based dealer said.</p>
<p>The key All Ordinaries index finished the week at 2,355.0, after touching an all-time high of 2,380.8 during the week.</p>
<p>Over the week the index gained 18.2 points or 0.8 percent.</p>

<p>TAIPEI - Taiwan share prices are expected to settle into a consolidation as the market finds strong support following tumbles in the second half of the week, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;There is really no clear trend seen as firms are expected to report mixed profit results for the first three quarters this year,&quot; said George Hou of Jardine Fleming.</p>
<p>On Friday the index closed at 6,475.42 points, compared to 6,578.36 a week earlier. A 6,400-6,550 range was seen for next week.</p>
<p>- - - -</p>
<p>WELLINGTON - New Zealand shares ended the week by posting yet another 32-month closing high and despite a Reserve Bank warning that it saw no scope for a further easing in monetary conditions.</p>
<p>Brokers said the market was optimistic that the rally would continue. &quot;Everybody is expecting an easing. The NZSE-40 Capital Index closed at 2,361.08, 111.54 points up on last week's 2,249.54 close.</p>
