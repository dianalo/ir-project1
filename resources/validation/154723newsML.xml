<p>Stocks in Vienna closed marginally lower on Wednesday on what traders said was largely technical selling.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks as if we're going to continue with a soft bias,&quot; said one trader, adding &quot;the next support is at 1,050 points on the ATX.&quot;</p>
<p>The ATX index of 21 blue chips lost 1.94 points, or 0.18 percent, to close at 1,060.30 after trading within a tight 1,056.91 to 1,064.42 points.</p>
<p>&quot;From a technical point of view, the market lacks energy to push higher,&quot; said another trader, expecting a soft market tomorrow ahead of a long weekend.</p>
<p>The market will be closed on Friday for All Saints Day.</p>
<p>Of the ATX's constituents, 13 fell while eight gained.</p>
<p>The top loser was chip-maker AMS, shedding 3.69 percent to close at 720.9 schillings ahead of its nine-month earnings figures tomorrow.</p>
<p>&quot;There're real shivers in the market over what comes out tomorrow from AMS,&quot; said one trader.</p>
