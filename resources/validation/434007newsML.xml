<headline>Axa to purge finances after merger - paper.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-03-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>France's Axa, in the throws of a merger to create the world's second largest insurer, plans to take advantage of a breathing space to purge the finances of junior partner UAP, a French newspaper said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>French financial daily Les Echos said in a front page story that Axa was planning to carry out hefty provisioning at Union des Assurances de Paris with the result that UAP would report a 1996 loss of six to seven billion francs ($1-1.2 billion).</p>
<p>The newspaper said Axa -- currenly called Axa-UAP -- was also planning to cash in on the Paris stock exchange's recent surge to cut stakes in Elf Aquitaine, Banque Nationale de Paris and to sell off Banque Worms.</p>
<p>Axa and UAP announced plans in November to merge, creating Europe's biggest insurance firm, but will only publish combined results for the 1997 financial year onwards.</p>
<p>Les Echos said Axa planned to profit in the interim period with a clean-up job on UAP's accounts which would affect the combined group's equity funds rather than its balance sheet.</p>
<p>Axa, which now owns more than 90 percent of UAP but does not complete the merger legally until later this year, declined to comment on the report ahead of board approval of 1996 figures.</p>
<p>&quot;The Axa group cannot comment. The accounts have not been adopted,&quot; a spokeswoman said in reply to a query from Reuters.</p>
<p>Les Echos said there would be hefty technical provisions for life and group insurance businesses UAP Vie and UAP collectives and also for the deconsolidating of BNP and further provisions of 400 million francs in 1996 for Banque Worms.</p>
<p>It said Banque Worms had cost UAP 15 billion francs over the five years, not including the 1996 provisions.</p>
<p>On stake sales, the newspaper said UAP's share portfolio had gained around 10 billion francs due to a recent rise in French stock prices, a gain which Axa-UAP planned to cash in on by pursuing an asset sale programme begun in January.</p>
<p>The paper noted that Axa-UAP had reduced its stake to slightly below five percent in Credit National, and cut its stake in Generale des Eaux to three percent.</p>
<p>&quot;In order to spread out its assets better, it plans to reduce by a half its stake in Elf (three percent) to build up its position in Total,&quot; the paper said.</p>
<p>It would also reduce its stake in BNP. &quot;With 12 percent of the capital now, it is expected to reduce this to around five or six percent in the near future,&quot; it said, noting this would be equivalent to BNP's stake in Axa-UAP.</p>
<p>The group was also planning to sell its stakes in the holding companies of Lazard, Eurafrance and Gaz et Eaux, Les Echos said.</p>
<p>All sales would be carried out on the market with full knowledge of the heads of the companies involved.</p>
<p>Axa shares were trading marginally below the level of the overall CAC-40 leading share index shortly after the open of business, up 0.61 percent at 378.7 francs. The index was up 0.8 percent at the same time. ($ = 5.743 French Francs)</p>
