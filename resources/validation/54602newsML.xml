<p>More than 10,000 demonstrators marched through central Hong Kong on Sunday to protest at Japan's claim to a group of disputed islands in east China Sea.</p>
<p>The demonstration was the latest and largest in a growing wave of anti-Japanese protests sweeping the British colony which was sparked by Japan's sovereignty claim over the islands, known as Diaoyu in Chinese and Senkakus in Japanese.</p>
<p>The rally, organised by Hong Kong's Democratic Party, meant pro-democracy and pro-China political parties, which are usually at loggerheads, put aside their differences to march together.</p>
<p>Taiwanese nationalist flags, carried by a dozen Taiwanese activists who flew to Hong Kong to attend the rally, were flying next to Chinese communist flags.</p>
<p>Protesters, among them children and elderly, shouted &quot;Get out of Diaoyu Islands&quot; and &quot;Down with Japanese militarism&quot; as they marched from the Victoria Park to the central business district where the Japanese Consulate is located.</p>
<p>A 92-year-old woman, who experienced Japanese atrocities during World War Two, told reporters during the march that it was something she needed to do. In central Hong Kong, protesters burned a Japanese flag.</p>
<p>Protesters urged China and Taiwan to stand firm against Japanese &quot;aggression&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We demand the two governments to take out some courage in standing firm against the Japanese,&quot; Democratic Party legislator Cheung Man-kwong told protesters.</p>
<p>Disputes over the islands resurfaced recently after Japanese rightwingers built a lighthouse and war memorial on one of the islands, sparking a wave of protests that has united Chinese across the region.</p>
<p>A group of activists in Hong Kong will sail to the islands on October 5 to try to dismantle the lighthouse and the war memorial.</p>
<p>The uninhabited archipelago lies 300 km (190 miles) west of Okinawa island and 200 km (125 miles) east of Taiwan. They are subject to rival claims by Beijing, Taipei and Tokyo.</p>
