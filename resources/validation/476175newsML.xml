<p>Brady bond prices ended off sharply across the board amid continued nervousness over the U.S. interest rate environment as evidenced by a rocky trading session in the U.S. stock market, Brady traders said.</p>
<p>Spreads on Brady issues were seen wider by 20 to 30 basis points across the board, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;This wasn't a Treasury-driven selloff as prices were next to unchanged from Thursday's levels, pure and simple - it's emerging market spread-widening, partially driven by fears about the stock market selloff,&quot; said one Brady trader.  </p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended a volatile trading session off 157.11 points at 6583.48.</p>
<p>&quot;Primarily its been a dealer-driven down trade,&quot; said another trader. &quot;The focus is nothing more important than what interest rates and the stock market, in the U.S., are doing.&quot;</p>
<p>The Benchmark U.S. 30-year Treasury bond closed off 5/32 at 94-4/32 to yield 7.10 percent, compared with Thursday's 7.08 percent yield at the close.</p>
<p>At 1730 EST/2230 GMT, Argentine par bonds and Mexican pars fell sharply losing 2 points to trade at 61-7/8 bid, 70 bid, respectively.  </p>
<p>Venezuela pars also dropped two points to trade at 69-3/4 bid, while Brazilian &quot;C&quot; bonds were off 1-7/8 at 73-3/4 bid.</p>
<p>&quot;It's 100 percent general market volatility,&quot; said Amy Falls, Director of emerging market research at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co Inc.</p>
<p>&quot;In our view there's definitely a connection between the high-yield market and the emerging markets,&quot; Falls said.</p>
<p>&quot;What's happended is of course the high-yield market is highly correlated with the Dow,&quot; Falls said.</p>
