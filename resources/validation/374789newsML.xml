<p>South African long bonds ended strong but off their best levels on Thursday after a hectic morning session which saw yields falling close to 30 basis points on massive offshore buying, traders said.</p>
<p>They said sentiment was boosted by a flood of Eurorand issues and perceptions offshore that the South African market currently presented good levels to buy stock.</p>
<p>The eagerly awaited event of the day was Finance Minister Trevor Manuel's adjustment budget speech which confirmed the government was on track to meet its 5.1 percent deficit target but otherwise proved to be a bit of a non-event.</p>
<p>Asked whether the deficit might be lower than 5.1 percent, Manuel said this was possible -- depending on final figures.</p>
<p>At 1410 GMT government's benchmark R150 stock was at 14.80 percent from 15.05 percent late on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The market soared on offshore buying with (net buying) figures between 600 million and one billion rand being bandied around,&quot; a trader at a leading bank said.</p>
<p>He said underlying sentiment was strong with further strength seen on Friday to 14.75 percent on the downside and a short-term trading range of between 14.70 percent to 14.85 percent.</p>
<p>The December producer price index, released late in the morning, was overshadowed by Manuel's speech. PPI came in within expectations, rising 1.0 percent month-on-month from 0.5 percent and 8.8 percent year-on-year compared with a 8.5 percent rise.</p>
<p>Foreigners bought a net 477.84 million rands worth of South African bonds on Wednesday after selling 243.48 million on Tuesday, the Bond Exchange said. Nominal cumulative turnover was 5.6 billion rand on Wednesday from 8.69 billion rand on Tuesday, it said.</p>
<p>On the currency market, the rand ended off its best levels after benefitting from the stronger bond market during the morning session.</p>
<p>But profit-taking saw the currency retrace gains in the afternoon and dealers said comments by Trade and Industry minister Alec Erwin on tarrif reforms had also unnerved the market.</p>
<p>Erwin told parliament tariff reforms planned under South Africa's GEAR macro-economic plan would help bring the rand to its correct level and previous subsidies and tariffs had the effect of overvaluing the currency.</p>
<p>At 1410 GMT the rand was trading at 4.4105/4135 on the dollar from 4.4050/4080 late on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The rand strengthened purely on the back of the bond market...we saw quite a lot of offshore dollar sales,&quot; a trader at a foreign bank said.</p>
<p>He said there had been a muted reaction to Manuel's speech which contained nothing &quot;untoward&quot;.</p>
<p>In the near-term, traders expected a wide 4.38 to 4.48 range. Underlying sentiment was bullish, they said.</p>
<p>Against the crosses, the rand was last trading at 7.1543/1651 against sterling from 7.1915/2040 late on Wednesday. It was trading at 0.3819/3824 marks from  0.3810/3816 previously.</p>
<p>South Africa's money market shortage fell back further to 9.171 billion rand on Wednesday from 9.588 billion rand on Tuesday, the Reserve Bank said.</p>
<p>Three-month NCDs rates were quoted steady at between 16.40 to 16.65 percent, while the 90-day BA rate was also unchanged at between 15.80 to 16.05 percent bid.</p>
