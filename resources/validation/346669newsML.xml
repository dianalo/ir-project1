<p>Military police returned to work on Friday after a one-day protest but said the government must tell them by Saturday what severance pay they will receive when Guatemala's peacetime changes cut military jobs.</p>
<p>&quot;They are working today and waiting for an answer from the government on Saturday,&quot; a military police radio operator told Reuters on Friday. He refused to give his name.</p>
<p>About 1,000 armed Guatemalan military police on Wednesday night defied their commanders and seized their own compound in the first army rebellion against terms of a peace treaty signed last month.</p>
<p>Military police refused to report to work guarding banks and businesses in the capital during the one-day protest -- the first by the country's powerful army since the Dec. 29 peace treaty that ended a 36-year war in which 140,000 Guatemalans died or disappeared.</p>
<p>Defence Ministry representatives met with police on Thursday, and negotiator Gen. Manuel Ventura promised them an answer by Saturday on their demands for severance pay.</p>
<p>The 4,000-strong military police (PMA) will be dissolved this year as part of government promises to leftist rebels. The peace accords do not specify what compensation the police will get when their jobs are eliminated.</p>
<p>The government pledged in the treaty to cut the armed forces by a third. The army has played a pivotal and at times, a brutal role in political life for much of Guatemala's recent history.</p>
<p>Protesters complained that the guerrillas of the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unit had won a better deal in the peace accords than they did. International aid will provide job training and housing assistance for ex-rebels.</p>
<p>The government refused to call the act a rebellion. Presidential spokesman Ricardo de la Torre told reporters the uprising was a &quot;labor dispute.&quot;</p>
<p>Army spokesman Col. Otto Noack told Reuters the incident was not a revolt because there was no fighting or violence.</p>
<p>An editorial in the daily newspaper El Grafico questioned the government's interpretation of events.</p>
<p>&quot;As much as the official authorities insist on minimising the attitude adopted by members of the Military Police ... the reality is this is a serious problem,&quot; the editorial said.</p>
<p>Protesting soldiers toting machine guns manned lookout posts on the compound's perimeter wall, and roadblocks made of tires were put up in surrounding streets.</p>
