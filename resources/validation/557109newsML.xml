<p>Swedish film director and writer Bo Widerberg, known for sensuous soft focus shots and socially critical work, died on Wednesday, his family said. He was 66.</p>
<p>His last film, All Things Fair, was nominated for an Oscar last year.</p>
<p>Born on June 8, 1930 in Malmo, Sweden, of a modest family background, Widerberg left school early and worked at odd jobs before pursuing writing. He went on to write novels, short stories and a radio play.</p>
<p>The young director made a name for himself with his 1963 black-and-white film Raven's End about an aspiring writer living with his working class parents in 1930s Sweden.</p>
<p>He won international acclaim with his 1967 film, Elvira Madigan, a tragic romance set in 19th-century Sweden between a married nobleman and a tightrope walker who elope to spend a last summer together before committing suicide.</p>
<p>His last film, which was nominated for the best foreign movie Oscar, was set in Sweden in 1943 and about a 15-year-old boy who has a love affair with his teacher. Johan Widerberg, the director's son, played the role of the student.</p>
<p>His other films include The Pram, Love 65, Adalen 31, The Ballad of Joe Hill, Stubby, The Man on the Roof, The Man from Mallorca and The Serpent's Way.</p>
<p>He is survived by his four children.</p>
