<p>Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong on Tuesday called for a peaceful end to a dispute between Beijing and Manila over who owns tiny islands in the South China Sea, warning that a conflict would hurt the whole region.</p>
<p>&quot;We in ASEAN urge that any dispute between claimants of islands or pieces of rock should be resolved in a peaceful manner,&quot; Goh told a news conference in Manila on the second day of a three-day visit.</p>
<p>Singapore and the Philippines are both members of the seven-country ASEAN, the Association of South East Asian Nations.</p>
<p>&quot;It is an ASEAN concern because if there is a dispute say between China and the Philippines, the conflict becomes one of military conflict and that is going to upset communications and the freedom of navigation,&quot; Goh said.</p>
<p>The Spratly Islands, a cluster of reefs and islets in the South China Sea believed to hold valuable oil deposits, are claimed wholly or in part by China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and the Philippines.</p>
<p>A long-standing row over the Spratlys between the Philippines and China flared in April when Manila accused Beijing of sending naval ships near islands which the Philippines claims.</p>
<p>Beijing in turn protested against the hoisting of the Philippine flag over Scarborough shoal, a barely visible group of rocks north of the Spratlys.</p>
<p>It has subsequently demanded Manila release 21 Chinese fishermen it captured near the shoal which, although in the Philippines 200-mile exclusive economic zone, China considers historically belongs to Beijing.</p>
<p>&quot;The dispute should be settled in conformity with international laws,&quot; Goh said.</p>
<p>&quot;Basically it should be resolved peacefully. Any conflict is no good for the countries concerned, it is no good for ASEAN.&quot;</p>
<p>ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.</p>
