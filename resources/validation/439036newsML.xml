<p>Russia said on Thursday it had made progress in talks with NATO on the Western alliance's eastward expansion plans, signalling that an agreement to map out their future relationship may be in sight.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been certain progress, although we have to say the work is hard, especially on the central question of not bringing the NATO military structure closer to the east,&quot; Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Tarasov told a briefing.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency quoted Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin on Thursday as telling Russia's Defence Council: &quot;We are ready to discuss constructive initiatives on the part of NATO. Recently such proposals have been appearing.&quot;</p>
<p>Russia has for months steadfastly condemned NATO plans to invite former communist-ruled countries from eastern Europe into the alliance.</p>
<p>But a flurry of diplomatic activity in recent weeks has produced encouraging signs, although Russia continues to protest about the expansion plans. NATO is due to issue its first new membership invitations at a summit in Madrid in July.</p>
<p>NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana held the latest talks with Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov on Sunday but no details were released. Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton are due to discuss the issue at a summit in Helsinki on March 19-20.</p>
<p>&quot;On some questions there has been progress between Russia and NATO, but on other questions there has not been a nearing of positions,&quot; Tarasov said.</p>
<p>Russia and NATO are trying to reach a deal formally mapping out relations now that the Cold war is over. A stumbling block has been Moscow's demand that any agreement is legally binding.</p>
<p>Presidential press secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky said in a radio interview on Thursday that Moscow still wanted any deal to be binding but signalled that it was ready to consider various options on how it should be approved.</p>
<p>He said Moscow might consider concluding a document similar to the 1975 Helsinki Act which established a code on human rights, security and economic issues and was approved by state or government leaders. It was only politically binding.</p>
<p>&quot;We have the 1975 Helsinki Act whose binding nature has not been questioned by anyone yet. I mean there are different options,&quot; Yastrzhembsky said.</p>
<p>Tarasov said it was &quot;too soon to say&quot; whether Clinton and Yeltsin would sign any agreement.</p>
<p>But he said Primakov hoped to narrow differences on whether NATO should be allowed to move its military structures into new member states at his talks in Washington with Clinton and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.</p>
<p>&quot;Russia has some concrete proposals on this score, and Yevgeny Primakov will carry out detailed talks in Washington on the basis of these proposals,&quot; Tarasov said.</p>
<p>He said progress in the talks had not come through Russian sacrifices.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't mean that Russia made concessions. I think that we can say that our partners started paying more attention to the concerns Russia has expressed from the beginning regarding NATO expansion,&quot; he said.</p>
