<p>Passenger vehicle travel in Europe will rise by about 20 percent by 2005 and vehicle registrations will surge, particularly in Germany, according to an independent report released Sunday.</p>
<p>The Munich-based Ifo economic Institute said the number of passenger vehicles in the 15 European Union countries plus Norway, Switzerland and the eastern European states of Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland will rise by about 36.5 million vehicles to 205 million in 2005 from the 1994 level.</p>
<p>In Germany alone, Ifo predicted the number of registered passenger vehicles would rise by 7.3 million vehicles to 43 million vehicles in 2005 and account for about a quarter of all vehicles registered in Europe.</p>
<p>The vehicle-to-people ratio would also surge in the next 10 years, rising an average 15 percent, Ifo said in the report, which was prepared for the European Commission, the EU's executive body based in Brussels.</p>
<p>The highest concentration of vehicles will be in Luxembourg, with a ratio of 637 vehicles per 1,000 people. Italy will be second with 544 and Germany third with 512 vehicles per 1,000 people, the report said.</p>
<p>It added that the number of vehicles per resident in eastern Germany would catch up to the level in the west of the country by 2005.</p>
<p>The report used 1994 as a base year and listed the number of vehicles in the European Union, Norway, Switzerland and the four eastern European nations of the at 168.5 million vehicles.</p>
<p>The top concentration of vehicles then was in Luxembourg at 562 vehicles per 1,000 resident, while Italy had 487 vehicles and Switzerland was third at 442 vehicles. Germany was overall seen as having 438 vehicles per 1,000 residents. Former East Germany had a level of 383 vehicles while west Germany had 451 vehicles.</p>
