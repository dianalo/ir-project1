<title>TANZANIA: Rains break long drought in Tanzanian capital.</title>
<headline>Rains break long drought in Tanzanian capital.</headline>
<dateline>DAR ES SALAAM 1997-03-23</dateline>

<p>Heavy rain fell on the Tanzanian capital, Dar es Salaam, on Sunday -- bringing relief for three million citizens hit by drought over the past two months.</p>
<p>Men, women and children were out in the downpour, collecting water in plastic bowls, buckets and other utensils.</p>
<p>After three days of scattered showers and thunderstorms, Tanzania's directorate of meteorology said the seasonal long rains had arrived at last and could continue until mid-May.</p>
<p>On Sunday, the weather bureau forecast rain and thunderstorms for most of Tanzania's northern coastal strip and hinterland, including the drought-stricken Tanga region. Isolated thunderstorms were also expected around the northeast highlands including Kilimanjaro and Arusha, the meteorologists said.</p>
<p>There were also good prospects that the rain would spread north into Kenya, which is also experiencing a serious drought.</p>
<p>Large areas of Dar es Salaam are still without piped water due to declining levels in the main river catchment and an inadequate delivery pipeline that loses up to 70 percent by the time it reaches the capital.</p>
<p>While the onset of the rains is good news for most, it comes too late to prevent extensive damage wrought by drought on the agricultural sector -- especially coffee, cotton and tea -- trade sources said.</p>
