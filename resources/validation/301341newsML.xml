<p>Suspected separatist guerrillas killed six paramilitary soldiers in an attack on a communist politician in northeastern India, an army official said on Saturday.</p>
<p>The militants opened fire on vehicles carrying N. Mangising, a communist member of the Manipur state assembly, and his bodyguards in Ningthoukom village late on Friday, the official in Calcutta said.</p>
<p>The village is about 20 km (12 miles) from Manipur's capital Imphal.</p>
<p>The insurgents, believed to be members of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) separatist movement, shot dead the six bodyguards travelling with Mangising and wounded the politician and four other paramilitary soldiers.</p>
<p>The wounded were taken to hospital in Imphal.</p>
<p>There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but authorities believed the attack was revenge for the killing of two PLA activists earlier on Friday in a police raid in the same area of Manipur.</p>
<p>The PLA has been fighting for the independence of Manipur from India for nearly three decades.</p>
