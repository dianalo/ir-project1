<p>Whirlpool Corp said Monday continued margin pressure in a difficult European home-appliance market more than offset strong operating results in North American and Latin America.</p>
<p>Earlier, Whirlpool reported third quarter net income of $0.28 a share after a $30 million pre-tax charge for restructuring, compared with $0.85 a year ago. Third quarter 1996 operating earnings were $0.53 a share.  </p>
<p>Whirlpool said the previously announced restructuring is expected to save $37 million annually, once fully implemented by mid-1997.</p>
<p>The company said the decline and geographic mix of appliance pretax earnings will raise Whirlpool's full-year reported tax rate to about 60 percent. The third-quarter rate is 110 percent after adjusting for the first half of 1996.</p>
<p>In North America, Whirlpool's third-quarter shipments of the nine major home appliances, like those for the entire industry, were flat when compared with the prior-year period, the company said.  </p>
<p>Whirlpool's quarterly European results were hurt by ongoing economic and industry difficulties in key national markets and higher-than-planned product start-up costs. Those factors contributed to a small regional operating loss.</p>
<p>Near-term prospects for European economic and appliance-industry recovery remain uncertain, Whirlpool said. Pushed by strong trade and consumer acceptance of a wide range of redesigned appliances, Whirlpool Europe's revenues rose while industry volumes fell from the prior year.</p>
<p>Company earnings from Latin America jumped by 30 percent compared with a year ago, and were the best ever for the period, Whirlpool said. Affiliates in Brazil achieved substantially higher year-over-year results for the second consecutive quarter.</p>
<p>Quarterly revenues at Whirlpool Asia were up significantly, though the company sustained an operating loss as planned. Whirlpool said it expects the full-year operating loss there to be slightly higher than projected earlier.</p>
<p>Organizational changes announced in August are expected to improve the company's long-term cost competitiveness and profitability in the region.</p>
