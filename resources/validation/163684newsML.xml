<title>SOUTH KOREA: South Korean court sentences 39 more students.</title>
<headline>South Korean court sentences 39 more students.</headline>
<dateline>SEOUL 1996-11-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>A South Korean court on Monday jailed 16 students and gave suspended prison terms to 23 others for taking part in violent pro-North Korean campus protests in August, court officials said.</p>
<p>It was the third mass sentencing in a week in connection with the unrest at Seoul's Yonsei University during which a riot policeman died.</p>
<p>On Monday, the sixteen students were jailed for between 10 months and 2-1/2 years for taking part in an illegal protest, engaging in acts of violence and obstructing police in their duty, the officials said.</p>
<p>The criminal court gave suspended sentences to another 23.</p>
<p>Since Tuesday last week, a total of 189 students have been sentenced in a crackdown on a leftist student movement. A further 255 students are standing trial for their part in Yonsei protests.</p>
<p>The pro-democracy student campaign backed President Kim Young-sam's rise to power, but authorities say activists have been influenced by North Korea and posed threats to national security since Kim implemented Western-style democracy.</p>
<p>A total of 85 students have now been jailed for up to three years and more than 100 have their sentences suspended.</p>
<p>Presiding judge Park Byong-mook told the court on Monday the Yonsei protests had &quot;given enormous shocks to the people with (their) pro-North Korean nature and violence.&quot;</p>
<p>Park said the sentences were a warning against violence.</p>
<p>In August, riot police stormed Yonsei to end the seven-day occupation of two teaching blocks by students who were taking part in an annual pro-Korean unification rally and calling for the withdrawal of 37,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea.</p>
<p>One riot policeman died in pitched fighting during which students used petrol bombs, iron pipes and stones.</p>
<p>Seoul maintains it is committed to unification, but authorities accused the students of embracing North Korea's plan to leave intact both Pyongyang's communist system and Seoul's democratic government.</p>
<p>Police produced stacks of North Korean propaganda that they said had been seized from the students. North and South Korea are still technically at war since the 1950-53 Korean conflict was ended by a truce, not a ceasefire.</p>
<p>On Friday, a London-based human rights group, Amnesty International, accused the Seoul government of widespread human rights abuses after riot police raided Yonsei.</p>
<p>&quot;Police in South Korea were responsible for widepread and systematic ill-treatment after the students were arrested,&quot; Amnesty said in a report.</p>
<p>It also accused South Korean police of sexually assaulting arrested female students. &quot;Female students said that police had grabbed their breasts and other parts of their bodies and shouted sexual insults.&quot;</p>
<p>Almost 6,000 students were detained after the worst campus unrest since President Kim took power in 1993.</p>
<p>Subsequent efforts to stamp out left-wing ideology had led to an alarming rise in the number of political prisoners, it said.</p>
