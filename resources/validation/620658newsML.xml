<headline>IPO HIGHLIGHTS-Carey scores gains.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>Shares of Carey International Inc jumped nearly 18 percent after the Washington, D.C.-based company's initial public offering in heavy trading on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Shares rose to 12-3/8 from their IPO price of $10.50.</p>
<p>Analysts had said they expected solid demand for the company, which offers chauffered vehicle services such as buses to airports. Carey has affiliates in 420 cities in 65 countries and has said it aims to consolidate the highly fragmented vehicle chauffering industry, according to its prospectus.  </p>
<p>Carey International Inc offered 2.9 million shares in the offering, selling a stake of roughly 46 percent and raising about $30 million from the IPO.  Carey turned a profit of $2.8 million for fiscal 1996 on revenues of $59.5 million, but posted a loss of $195,000 on revenues of $43.5 million in fiscal 1995, according to its prospectus.</p>
<p>Montgomery Securities was the lead underwriter with Ladenburg Thalmann, a unit of New Valley Corp.</p>
<p>The stock was one of the most active on the Nasdaq early in the session with over 1.75 million shares traded.  </p>
<p>Real estate investment trust (REIT) Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc moved slightly higher in heavy early trading after its $135 million IPO, rising 5/8 to 20-5/8. The stock was one of the most heavily traded issues on the NYSE.</p>
<p>The gain surprised some IPO analysts who had forecast slimmer premiums. REITs are generally viewed as investment vehicle for income, not growth, since they pay 95 percent of their taxable income to shareholders to keep their special federal tax status. The sheer size of their offerings also tends to sharply limit opening premiums.</p>
<p>The 6.75 million shares, all sold by the company, priced at the low end of their estimated range of $20 to $22 shares.</p>
