<p>Wilson Kipketer made athletics history on Friday when he became the first person to win a world record bonus at a world championships.</p>
<p>The Kenyan-born Dane shattered the world 800 metres record by nearly a second in the fifth and final first round heat on the opening day of the three-day world indoor championships.</p>
<p>He earned $50,000 for his day's work with the probability of a further $50,000 for winning the final on Sunday.</p>
<p>Kipketer, the current world outdoor champion, was not allowed to compete at last year's Atlanta Olympics but finished the year as world number one after winning all 13 of his races.</p>
<p>He finished more than four seconds ahead of second-placed James Nolan of Ireland, crossing the line in one minute 43.96 seconds.</p>
<p>Kenyan Paul Ereng, the 1988 Olympic champion, set the previous mark of 1:44.84 at the 1989 world indoor championships in Budapest. It was the first time since the 1972 Munich Olympics that a world middle-distance record has been beaten in a heat.</p>
<p>&quot;I came here today and ran my perfect race,&quot; Kipketer said. &quot;The competition wasn't going to push me.</p>
<p>&quot;After the first lap when I clocked 24 something I thought I'd have to go for it. Nobody was following me, they were way behind.&quot;</p>
<p>American Olympic 100 metres champion Gail Devers faced an anxious wait before learning that she had qualified for Friday's 60 metres final.</p>
<p>Devers was given the same time of 7.15 seconds as Ekaterini Thanou in the semifinals and eventually awarded second place ahead of the Greek.</p>
<p>An appeal by the Greek federation was overturned.</p>
