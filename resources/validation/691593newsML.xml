<headline>US High Court sets Fibreboard asbestos deal review.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-06-27</dateline>
<text>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court Friday ordered more review of a $1.5 billion global, class- action settlement involving Fibreboard Corp and two of its insurers over asbestos-related claims.</p>
<p>Agreeing to pay the $1.5 billion under the 1993 settlement were Continental Casualty Co, a unit of CNA Financial Corp, which is a unit of Loews Corp, and Pacific Indemnity Co, a unit of the Chubb Corp.</p>
<p>The high court, in a brief order, set aside a U.S. appeals court ruling that upheld the settlement.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court ordered the appeals court to further consider the settlement in light of a high court ruling earlier this week that rejected a separate $1.3 billion settlement involving 20 former asbestos manufacturers.  </p>
<p>Fibreboard, which made asbestos-containing products from 1920 until 1971, faced numerous liability lawsuits for asbestos-related illnesses. The amount the insurers would have to pay triggered litigation in California state courts.</p>
<p>In 1993, Fibreboard, the two insurers and attorneys representing the victims announced a proposed global settlement in which a trust would be created to handle all future asbestos claims.</p>
<p>In a separate agreement, the insurers agreed to make available to Fibreboard $2 billion to defend and resolve the claims if the global settlement failed to win final approval.</p>
<p>A federal judge in Texas approved the settlement, and a U.S. appeals court in July upheld the judge's ruling.</p>
<p>In one Supreme Court appeal, attorneys for two asbestos victims questioned whether the case had been properly certified by mandating that members of the class comprising more than 100,000 future asbestos claimants could not opt out of the settlement.</p>
<p>In the other appeal, lawyers said the judge erred by predicating class certification entirely on the existence of a settlement.</p>
