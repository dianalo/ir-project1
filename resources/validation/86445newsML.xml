<p>The Kleinwort European Privatisation Investment Trust said on Monday its offer was worth 106.4 pence per share and one-fifth of a warrant to shareholders, compared with 104.8 pence from hostile bidder TR European Growth.  </p>
<p>KEPIT is offering shareholders the chance to invest in continuing European privatisation unit trust, a general Europe unit trust managed by M&amp;G, or a cash exit via a Kleinwort Benson money market fund.</p>
<p>TREG is offering a cash exit or the chance to invest in its own European investment trust.</p>
<p>Assuming that 75 percent of shareholders opt for a cash exit, KEPIT said that its offer showed better value as it has obtained a discount on the realisation of the 500-million-stg investment trust's portfolio and higher costs which would be borne by investors if they accepted TREG's offer.  </p>
<p>&quot;Having considered it most carefully, the independent directors believe that ther recommended proposal is more attractive to than TREG's offers,&quot; KEPIT said.</p>
<p>KEPIT said that its calculations apply whether 25 percent or 50 percent of investors opt for cash.</p>
<p>It added that if more than 75 percent of holders choose cash, it can also offer a better deal.</p>
<p>Assuming that there is a very high level of elections for cash, KEPIT has struck a deal with a broker on a programme trade, which will enable it to achieve favourable terms on the disposal of the portolio of shares.  </p>
<p>&quot;As a result, even if 100 percent of KEPIT investors elected for cash, which the independent directors do not consider likely, and this offer was accepted, the aggregate realisation costs and other costs to be borne by KEPIT investors should not exceed the aggregate costs under TREG's offers,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Under the assumption that 75 percent or less opt for cash, KEPIT said it had identified 2.6 million stg from fees to TREG, 4.0 million from TREG's own costs and 14.2 million from the realisation of the portfolio under TREG's offer, compared with 12.7 million for its own proposals.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the recommended offer, KEPIT holders will also receive a boost equivalent to 1.2 million stg as the shares held by KEPIT are transferred to the M&amp;G European trust without the cost of selling them.</p>
<p>It also said that shareholders opting for cash would be able to exit on November 25, whereas TREG offered no certain date. -- David Chance, London Newsroom 44 171 542 5887</p>
