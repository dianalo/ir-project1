<p>Former Argentine Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo said a preliminary deal on labor reforms struck by the government and trade unions undermines further modernisation of the economy.</p>
<p>&quot;This agreement between the (union federation) CGT and the government is not only a step backwards in the organization of labor markets and of labor in Argentina, but it also consolidates a corporate vestige which the (ruling) Justicialist (Peronist) Party unfortunately has,&quot; Cavallo said in a meeting with foreign correspondents.  </p>
<p>&quot;The role that the trade unions have within the Justicialist Party implies a severe limitation to the reforms pending in Argentina,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>After months of disagreement, the government and unions last week made progress on the issue of replacing redundancy pay with unemployment insurance. But they agreed to limit open competition in health care to union-run schemes, instead of allowing private health care companies to vie for unionised workers as clients.  </p>
<p>The CGT said the deal, which must still be submitted to businessmen to go ahead, might prompt it to drop a general strike planned for this month.</p>
<p>&quot;This agreement sets limits on the free choice by workers of their health care providers,&quot; Cavallo said.</p>
<p>He added that the deal &quot;monopolizes collective wage bargaining by the union leadership, hampering the possibility that workers' delegates in each company may be able to negotiate directly with their employer.&quot;  </p>
<p>Cavallo said centralized wage discussions hurt small and medium-sized businesses, which unlike large companies are not able to call in union bosses in for talks. He also questioned whether these bosses really represent workers.</p>
<p>&quot;I think they represent them hardly at all, because they win elections with money they take from the health care plans to finance their campaigns.&quot;</p>
<p>Cavallo also said it was a good idea for the government to obtain an Extended Fund Facility loan from the International Monetary Fund this year to make sure it had constant foreign supervision of its finances, thus preventing it from using cash for electoral purposes ahead of October mid-term polls.</p>
