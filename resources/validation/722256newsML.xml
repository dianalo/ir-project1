<p>Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index staged a strong technical rebound on Friday to score a record closing high and looks set to test its intra-day record high next week, analysts said.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index soared 386.06 points, or 2.60 percent, to 15,225.29, beating the previous closing high of 15,196.79 set on June 29.</p>
<p>The blue-chip index hit an all-time high of 15,363.61 on July 3.</p>
<p>The market shrugged off weak sentiment weighing on prices since Britain handed back Hong Kong to China on July 1, thanks to renewed interest in red-chip stocks and technical buying, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Technically speaking the market should go up further next week since the Hang Seng breached the record to close at a new high,&quot; said Franco Tong, sales manager at New China Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Hopes of asset injections and stake purchases boosted red chips, with the Hang Seng China-Affiliated Corporations Index jumping 134.43 points, or 4.22 percent, to finish at 3,319.45.</p>
<p>Banks were broadly higher, with smaller banks lifted by hopes they might be targets of mainland companies following news that COSCO Pacific Ltd planned to take a stake in Liu Chong Hing Bank.</p>
<p>&quot;The banking sector should continue to benefit from the news,&quot; Tong said.</p>
<p>Howard Gorges, vice chairman at South China Holdings, said the rebound had surprised investors and he expected more next week.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a very good rebound,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>One local broker also pointed to the futures market, where prices closed at a premium to the cash market.</p>
<p>&quot;The blue-chip index will definitely test the all-time high next week given that index futures closed at a premium to the spot index,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>July index futures jumped 445 points to close at 15,335, a 110-point premium to the spot index.</p>
