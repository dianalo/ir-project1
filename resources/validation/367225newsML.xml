<title>ITALY: Italy military court to re-try ex-Nazi Priebke.</title>
<headline>Italy military court to re-try ex-Nazi Priebke.</headline>
<dateline>ROME 1997-02-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>Italy's highest court ruled on Monday that a military court should hear the war crimes re-trial of former Nazi SS captain Erich Priebke.</p>
<p>Priebke, 83, is accused of complicity in multiple murder for his role in the massacre of 335 men and boys at the Ardeatine Caves near Rome on March 24, 1944.</p>
<p>Seventy-five of the victims were Jews.</p>
<p>The court had been asked to rule on which branch of the judiciary should hear the case after military and civilian judicial authorities both concluded that they did not have jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The ruling was a victory for the defence, which had sought another military trial.</p>
<p>At his first trial which ended on August 1, a military court found Priebke guilty but ordered him freed, citing extenuating circumstances which triggered an expired statute of limitations.</p>
<p>He was rearrested that night after relatives of the massacre's victims laid siege to the courthouse.</p>
<p>The verdict was quashed on appeal last October and Priebke is still being held in detention at a military prison in Rome.</p>
<p>Civil plaintiffs, representing family members of victims, had wanted Priebke re-tried in a civilian court, saying it would give a more stringent reading of the case than a military court.</p>
<p>The defence argued that the Nazi SS was a military force and so under military jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The date for the start of the new trial is due to be set by the military court.</p>
<p>Priebke has been jailed in Rome since November 1995 when he was extradited to Italy from Argentina, where he had lived openly since 1948.</p>
<p>Priebke admits shooting two victims and crossing names off a list but said he had to follow orders or be killed himself.</p>
<p>He also says the massacre was a legitimate wartime reprisal for a partisans' bomb attack in Rome the previous day which killed 33 soldiers loyal to Nazi occupying forces.</p>
<p>He will be tried with another former SS officer, 84-year-old ex-major Karl Hass, who was a prosecution witness at his first trial. He was later indicted on similar charges and is under house arrest in Rome.</p>
<p>Hass, 84, had been an unwilling prosecution witness at Priebke's first trial. He tried to avoid testifying by leaving Rome the day before he was to appear, but fell from the balcony of his hotel and broke his pelvis. He later testified from hospital.</p>
<p>Hass, who is under house arrest at a private clinic near Rome where he has been recovering, was charged along with Priebke because he too admitted a role in the massacre.</p>
