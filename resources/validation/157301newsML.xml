<p>Pakistani officials on Thursday dismissed demands from the powerful textile body for duty-free imports of at least one million 375-lb bales of cotton to make up for a feared crop shortfall.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no need to import cotton as output will be enough to feed the textile industry,&quot; Barkat Ali Soomro, vice-president of the state-run Pakistan Central Cotton Committee, said.</p>
<p>He told Reuters the consensus estimate for cotton production was 9.2-9.5 million bales in 1996/97 (July-June), down from 9.94 million in 1995/96 output and this year's target of 10 million.</p>
<p>Raw cotton arrivals at ginneries were more than 50 percent higher than last year, Soomro said.</p>
<p>According to the state-run Cotton Export Corporation (CEC), arrivals had risen to 2.26 million bales by October 24 from 1.487 million in the year-ago period.</p>
<p>However, the All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (APTMA) argues that output will not exceed nine million bales, or 400,000 short of what it says are the textile industry's needs of 9.4 million bales. The industry used 8.9 million last year.</p>
<p>The textile lobby wants the government to allow duty-free import of at least one million bales in 1996/97.</p>
<p>Maqbool Sadiq, chairman of the private Karachi Cotton Association, said the demand was valid as pests had eroded the quality and strength of cotton fibre in the new crop. &quot;The quality is not good after white fly attack,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Dealer Nadershaw Kabraji said the textile industry had become more quality-conscious and was seeking better-quality cotton, which was often unavailable.</p>
<p>But Aijazuddin Ghauri, secretary of the Pakistan Cotton Ginners Association, said dealers and textile industrialists differed widely on the quality of cotton fibre.</p>
<p>&quot;Besides this fight there is a rumour of a short crop of between 9.0 and 9.5 million bales that pushed domestic prices up,&quot; Ghauri said.</p>
<p>Dealer Khushi Ram said the textile lobby demand was part of an annual struggle between growers and manufacturers, which he said only hedge trading could resolve.</p>
<p>Exporter Amir Merchant said farmers were holding back stocks in the hope of getting higher prices.</p>
<p>APTMA chairman Javed Saifullah Khan complained this week that the textile industry had to pay total charges of about 14 percent on cotton imports. The costs included import duty, inspection charges and withholding tax.</p>
<p>&quot;The demand for one million bales import could rise if the government allowed export of cotton,&quot; he said, &quot;Cotton export is duty-free and its import should also be allowed duty-free.&quot;</p>
<p>The crop size may become clearer after government officials, growers and ginners meet in Multan on November 3.</p>
<p>The IMF had delayed disbursements of the standby loan provided in December 1995 and said it must complete a review of the standby agreement before payments could be resumed.</p>
<p>Muddassar Malik, senior analyst and director of BMA Capital Management, said the market was looking to the new team to maintain good relations with the IMF by bolstering financial discipline.</p>
<p>&quot;Politically, this is a sign of realisation if not maturity, that a strong Finance Ministry was badly needed,&quot; Malik said.</p>
<p>Pakistan needs the IMF's seal of approval for its economic policies to stave off a threatened downgrade of its credit ratings and maintain access to international capital markets.</p>
<p>Critics had argued that Bhutto lacked the expertise to run the Finance Ministry herself and should appoint a new economic team to try to restore Pakistan's battered international image.  </p>
