<p>Colombia's peso closed 1.7 lower on the dollar at 994 in quiet trading on the country's interbank market, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said the peso extended its previous day's gains early in the session, rising to an intra-day high of 991.50 on dollar sales by exporters.  It weakened late in the session, however, when banks that were short dollars jumped into the market to buy.  Dealers said there was no sign of intervention by the central bank, even though it had threatened repeatedly -- in messages flashed across trading screens -- to buy dollars if the peso rose above the ceiling of its daily floating rate exchange band.</p>
<p>The top of the band was set near the peso's intra-day high Wednesday at 991.09.</p>
<p>Dealers reported 251 trades in Wednesday's session for a total of $104.7 million.</p>
<p>The central bank, or Banco de la Republica, has been under heavy pressure to curb the peso's gains since June, when it was trading at more than 1,070 to the dollar, because its rapid appreciation makes Colombian exports less attractive abroad and erodes the real value of export revenues.</p>
