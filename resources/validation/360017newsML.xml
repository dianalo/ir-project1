<p>Central and eastern Europe, facing a looming pensions crisis, are looking to private pension funds not only to ease pressure on state coffers but also as a way of boosting gross domestic product (GDP) to West European levels.</p>
<p>&quot;The pension system will collapse if nothing is done while only pension funds can boost GDP and prevent Central Europe remaining a backwater of Europe,&quot; said Adam Gere, managing director of U.K.-based Sedgewick Nodle Lowndes Budapest office, and head of the government task force drafting new pension legislation.</p>
<p>The problem with the region's communist-model systems, Gere believes, is that with an ageing population state funds are having to be spread more thinly, meaning people get out less than they put in.</p>
<p>The Czech republic's initial solution has been to raise the retirement age so that total contributions increase.</p>
<p>The government was the first in the region to introduce pension reform when on January 1 last year it increased the pensionable age from 60 to 62 for men and from 55 to between 57 and 61 for women, depending on how many children they have.</p>
<p>The fund is still a state-run &quot;pay as you go&quot; model but incorporates a system of top-up voluntary contributions which entitle the contributor to a direct subsidy proportional to their voluntary payments.</p>
<p>But Gere believes raising the retirement age does little to offset the fundamental flaw in the systems -- its disregard of differences in individual savings, which encourages the evasion of contribution payments.</p>
<p>&quot;The non-compliance problem is horrendous,&quot; he said. &quot;Hungary's government should be receiving 30.5 percent of the country's total payroll but is currently getting less than 25 percent -- it's losing 180 billion forints a year.&quot;</p>
<p>Hungary's plan, which the government hopes parliament will pass by May for introduction in 1998, is for a compulsory two-tier system, with two-thirds of contributions pay-as-you-go and one-third paid into private pension funds.</p>
<p>Young people starting work in 1998 would be obliged to use both systems immediately while other workers would increase their compulsory private fund payments over a transitional period up to 2009.</p>
<p>The government believes the revamped system will enable private funds to raise the country 's current sluggish growth of around 1.5 percent by one to 1.5 percentage points annually from 2000, while also boosting private savings to 16-17 percent of GDP by 2010 and 40 percent by 2020.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a compromise with the state pension authority, whose leaders are opposed to a complete private system as they would lose their jobs,&quot; Gere said. &quot;Even so, I would think the total capitalisation of Hungary's equity markets will soon triple or quadruple.&quot;</p>
<p>The Czech republic, aware of the need to do more, is likely to bring in further reform, says Vladimir Kreidl, an economist with Patria Finance investment bank and an expert on pensions.</p>
<p>&quot;The government is, I think, well aware of the fact that the population is going to be older and older. That's centrally the main reason for (more) changes,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>According to Kreidl, the Czech government is preparing for a radical overhaul which would create a system similar to Hungary's plan with a compulsory pay-as-you-go element, and both compulsory and voluntary private contributions.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Poland began its process of reform last year but most of the crucial decisions have yet to be taken and this could prove difficult in 1997, an election year in which the ruling leftist coalition may not want to risk the anger of millions of pensioners who fear change, analysts say.</p>
<p>Bulgaria and Romania have also made only modest attempts at reforming their chronically under-funded pension systems.</p>
<p>The Bulgarians set up a National Insurance Institute last year to supervise Bulgaria's pension fund, which for the past five decades was part of the state budget.</p>
<p>Uncontrolled spending of the insurance taxes transfered directly to the budget led to current meagre pension payouts. The highest pension in Bulgaria has melted due to the financial crisis to less than $10 from around $50 two years ago.</p>
<p>The revamped fund will include security payments accumulated so far, subsidies from the budget and some privatisation proceeds.</p>
<p>Parallel private insurance societies will be allowed under a separate law which parliament has yet to approve.</p>
<p>Romanians still get their meagre pensions -- currently $50 a month and falling -- through a state-run pension scheme inherited from the former communist regime and funded from the social insurance budget.</p>
<p>In 1995, two private local pension funds were created, without significant activity so far. Advertising for the two funds was almost non-existent.</p>
<p>The new centrist government which emerged after last November's election has not yet unveiled immediate plans to change the present pension legislation.</p>
