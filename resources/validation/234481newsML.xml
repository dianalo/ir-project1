<p>French troops were patrolling the streets of Paris on Thursday amid fears of further bomb attacks following Tuesday's train blast that killed two people, thought to be the work of Algerian Islamic guerrillas.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre, who has ordered 1,800 troops to bolster police around the country, dismissed suggestions that France had lowered its guard too soon after a string of blasts last year by Algerian Moslem militants.</p>
<p>&quot;We have never abandoned the war we are waging against terrorists,&quot; he told reporters as he inspected increased security in the capital on Wednesday night that included spot checks on cars on the Champs-Elysees avenue.</p>
<p>Yet investigators said there had been unconfirmed intelligence reports in recent weeks that guerrillas of the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) were planning renewed bombings in France.</p>
<p>The GIA claimed responsibility for a series of blasts last year that killed eight people and injured more than 160 others, accusing France of backing the military authorities in Algiers in a war against Islamists.</p>
<p>Tuesday's bomb at the Port Royal station on a suburban express rail line killed two people -- a Canadian woman and a Frenchman -- and injured 88.</p>
<p>&quot;The GIA trail,&quot; the daily Liberation said in a front-page headline on Thursday, saying the French secret services had been worried by threats by the new leader of the GIA, Antar Zouabri.</p>
<p>&quot;France fights Moslems. That's why we maintain the same attitude towards this country as our predecessors, the emirs of the GIA,&quot; it quoted Zouabri as saying in September.</p>
<p>Municipal workers continued sealing off thousands of rubbish bins around the capital and installing crash barriers to prevent car bombs from being parked near school entrances.</p>
<p>Police banned groups of children from the Metro underground railway, ordered public toilets to be locked and stepped up surveillance at markets -- all targets of bomb attacks in 1995 in Paris and Lyon.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Alain Juppe noted &quot;striking similarities&quot; between the bomb and blasts last year. No one claimed responsibility for Tuesday's blast and Juppe told parliament investigators were jumping to no conclusions.</p>
<p>Investigators said the type of explosive used was identical to the chemicals in the 1995 bombs. And the timing of the blast during the rush-hour, the use of a hollowed-out gas canister stuffed with explosives and including nails to make the blast more deadly all matched last year's explosions.</p>
<p>A right-wing deputy and former anti-terrorism magistrate, Alain Marsaud, said France should put up wanted posters for a suspected organiser of last year's bombs, Ali Touchent, 39.</p>
<p>Police and justice authorities ended last year's campaign after killing one suspect and arresting hundreds of others. But Touchent, suspected of having recruited Arab youths from depressed suburbs in the Lyon region for the GIA, got away.</p>
<p>A leader of Algeria's outlawed Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), less militant than the GIA, condemned the bomb and said France was making slow moves towards helping end the warring in Algeria, which won independence from France in 1962.</p>
<p>&quot;We condemn as strongly as possible...this criminal act,&quot; Rabah Kebir told France 2 television. The FIS took up arms against Algiers in 1992 after the military authorities scrapped elections it was poised to win. Some 50,000 people are estimated to have died in the fighting since.</p>
