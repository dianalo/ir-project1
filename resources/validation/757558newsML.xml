<p>A former police officer was sentenced to life in prison on Friday for the murder of a Swede who authorities once suspected in the 1986 assassination of Swedish Prime Minister Olaf Palme, a court official said.</p>
<p>Lamont Claxton Underwood was sentenced to life in prison for first-degree murder plus 40 years for kidnapping. A Watauga County jury on Monday convicted him in the death of Viktor Gunnarsson, deputy court clerk Richard Graham said.</p>
<p>Gunnarsson, 40, was among the first suspects questioned in the unsolved slaying of Palme, but eventually was released and later moved to North Carolina, although he never became a U.S. citizen.</p>
<p>Gunnarsson's nude body was found covered with snow in a remote mountainous area of western North Carolina on Jan. 7, 1994. Underwood was arrested on Oct. 12, 1995.</p>
<p>An autopsy determined that Gunnarsson's body had been in the woods for several weeks and the cause of death was two .22-calibre gunshots, to the head and neck at close range. Lengths of tape also were found near Gunnarsson's body, indicating that his hands had been tied, police said.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said Underwood was jealous over Gunnarsson's relationship with a woman both men had dated, and he kidnapped the Swede from his apartment in December 1993.</p>
<p>Underwood was a policeman in Salisbury, North Carolina, at the time of the killing.</p>
<p>At the trial, the prosecution presented 17 hairs found in the trunk of Underwood's car that were identified as Gunnarsson's through DNA analysis.</p>
