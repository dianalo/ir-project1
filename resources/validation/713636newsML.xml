<p>The Brussels bourse' Bel-20 index ended below 2,500 points on Tuesday after breaking above it for the first time on Monday as French, Dutch and UK markets also took a breather from recent rises.</p>
<p>Dealers said the Bel-20, which ended 11.26 points or 0.45 percent easier at 2,493.21, could bounce to above 2,500 again on Wednesday if the Dow Jones  .DJI held on to the nearly 50-point gain it had notched up by 1530 GMT.</p>
<p>If the Dow fell back, the Bel-20 would too, they said, with a first obvious support at the 2,458-2,444 gap opened on July 3.</p>
<p>&quot;The market needed some consolidation and may need some more,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>Virtually all blue chips ended lower, especially those who had shown strong gains recently, such as cement maker CBR and bank holding group Almanij.</p>
<p>Retailer GIB, which has been cited as a turnaround and takeover candidate, bucked the trend, ending 35 francs higher at 1,815 in busy trade.</p>
