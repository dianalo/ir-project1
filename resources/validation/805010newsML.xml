<p>These are the highlights of the main stories in the Bosnian press on Monday. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.</p>
<p>DNEVNI AVAZ</p>
<p>- President of the union of war invalids, Amir Kriko, says a revision of soldiers' bank books should be carried out at the same as a revision of war invalids' certificates.</p>
<p>- The June birth rate in the Moslem-Croat federation decreased 0.6 percent compared to the previous month and the mortality rate decreased 1.6 percent, state statistics agency said.</p>
<p>- U.S. envoy Robert Gelbard is due to meet on Monday members of Bosnia's collective presidency to discuss the design of a new flag and common currency, the power struggle in the Serb entity and problems in the functioning of the federation.</p>
<p>- Carl Bildt, the former High Representative to Bosnia, says it is naive to expect that all problems in Bosnia will be solved by June next year when NATO peacekeeping troops are scheduled to withdraw.</p>
<p>- Bildt said recent U.S. criticism of current High Representative Carlos Westendorp was incorrect and counter-productive. It is a cowardly act to attack someone through an &quot;anonymous official,&quot; Bildt said.</p>

<p>OSLOBODJENJE</p>
<p>- The opposition Union of Social Democrats plans to request through its parliament deputies that Serb members of the Council of Ministers be sacked &quot;because they want to return Bosnia to the pre-Dayton situation&quot;.</p>
<p>- Some 500 Serbs are expected to return to their homes in the Lukavac area near Tuzla in the Moslem-Croat federation, Lukavac local authorities said. --Sarajevo Newsroom, +387-71-663-864</p>
