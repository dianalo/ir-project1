<p>In a sign of his campaign's confidence, President Bill Clinton on Sunday visited Virginia and Tennessee, states not critical to his re-election, and found time to have dinner with Vice President Al Gore.</p>
<p>The visits, the start of a three-day, seven-state campaign swing, illustrated the Clinton campaign's growing optimism as it races down the final stretch to the Nov. 5 election.</p>
<p>Ahead in all national polls -- the latest Reuters tracking poll gave Clinton a 13.4 percentage point lead over Republican Bob Dole while CNN/USA Today Gallup put it at 20 points -- Clinton appeared to be playing a complex campaign endgame.</p>
<p>On one hand he sought to buttress his commanding position in traditionally crucial Midwestern states like Illinois and Ohio, which he will visit on Monday and Tuesday.</p>
<p>On the other, he wanted to use the campaign's waning days to further objectives beyond his own re-election -- like positioning Gore for a 2000 run at the White House and helping Democratic candidates for Congress.</p>
<p>Appearing with Gore at an evening rally held at Nashville's Vanderbilt University, Clinton had nothing but praise for the vice president.</p>
<p>&quot;We spend so much time together now, it's almost like we can begin to speak in code,&quot; Clinton said. &quot;Two or three words and I can finish the sentence, and vice versa.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There has never been a relationship quite like this in American history between a president and vice president,&quot; he added. &quot;It's been one of the most richly rewarding things in my life and I think it's been very good for the American people.&quot;</p>
<p>Making his fourth visit to Tennessee since August, Clinton seemed intent on making sure Gore not suffer the embarrassment of losing his home state, or doing poorly there.</p>
<p>There seemed little danger of that, as one recent Tennessee opinion poll gave Clinton a 15 percentage point lead over Dole, but the Clinton-Gore campaign was taking no chances.</p>
<p>Clinton and Gore were later scheduled to have dinner at a Nashville restaurant before the president flew on to St. Louis, where he was to spend the night.</p>
<p>Earlier, in another token of his confidence, Clinton campaigned in Virginia, a state that has not sent a Democrat to the White House since 1964, when it supported Lyndon Johnson.</p>
<p>At an outdoor rally in Springfield, Va, Clinton campaigned with Mark Warner, a Democratic businessman seeking to oust three-term Republican John Warner from the Senate, and joked about the state's long Republican tradition.</p>
<p>&quot;Most people in Virginia have been voting against members of my party for president for over three decades now and I know how hard it is to break a habit,&quot; he said. &quot;One of the things we all teach our kids is that some habits have to be broken.&quot;</p>
<p>As he has done throughout the campaign, Clinton sought to paint himself as the candidate of the future and, without mentioning him by name, to portray Dole as a man of the past.</p>
<p>&quot;Your fellow Virginians ... did a great thing for America when they and their native sons led us into the 19th Century 200 years ago,&quot; he added. &quot;Virginia can help lead America into the 21st Century nine days from now.&quot;</p>
<p>Recent polls gave Clinton a six- to nine-point lead over Dole in Virginia, one of the most reliably Republican states over the past three decades.</p>
<p>On Monday Clinton was scheduled to make speeches in St. Louis, Minneapolis and Chicago and on Tuesday in Columbus, Ohio, and Philadelphia.</p>
<p>After a one-night stopover at the White House, Clinton was to begin a seven-day campaign blitz across the country ending in Little Rock, Arkansas, for election night -- near the site where he declared his candidacy in October 1991.</p>
