<headline>FBI offers $500,000 reward for Olympic bomber.</headline>
<dateline>ATLANTA 1996-12-09</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation on Monday made public the tape recording of a telephone warning of the Olympic Park bombing in Atlanta and offered a reward for information leading to the arrest of the bomber or bombers.</p>
<p>The FBI announced it would pay &quot;up to $500,000&quot; for photographs, videotapes or information that helps catch the person who planted the bomb on July 27 at Centennial Olympic Park.  </p>
<p>Announcing the reward at a news conference in Atlanta, FBI deputy director Weldon Kennedy called the bombing, which killed two people and injured more than 100, a &quot;vicious crime&quot; and appealed to the public for help.</p>
<p>&quot;This investigation continues to have our highest priority,&quot; Kennedy said.</p>
<p>Agents played a tape of a telephone warning called in before the bomb went off. The brief message said there was a bomb in the park and told authorities they had 30 minutes.</p>
<p>The FBI has said very little about the bombing in the 4-1/2 months since the explosion. Security guard Richard Jewell, who alerted authorities to a knapsack containing the bomb, was initially identified as a suspect but was cleared on Oct. 26.</p>
