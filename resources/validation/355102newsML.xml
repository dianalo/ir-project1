<title>TURKEY: Turkish tanks parade around Islamist district.</title>
<headline>Turkish tanks parade around Islamist district.</headline>
<dateline>ANKARA 1997-02-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>Tanks on Tuesday paraded through an Islamist-controlled Ankara district that staged an anti-Israel protest last week, in an apparent show of strength by the staunchly secularist army.</p>
<p>Hours later, Ankara state security court ordered the detention of Islamist mayor Bekir Yildiz over the protest in his district, Sincan, the state-run Anatolian news agency said.</p>
<p>Anatolian said 20 tanks, 15 armoured personnel carriers, military jeeps and heavy lorries were taking part in a training march through Sincan. Military officials denied the march was in response to the anti-Israeli rally.</p>
<p>&quot;This has nothing to do with that. This is training that we do all the time. This is the normal route of the tanks. Are they supposed to fly or something,&quot; a military official told Reuters.</p>
<p>The interior ministry has launched an investigation into the anti-Israel protest, organised under the name of &quot;Jerusalem night&quot; in Sincan last Friday.</p>
<p>A speech by Sincan mayor Yildiz has been criticised in the media as a call for the implementation of the strict Islamic sharia law.</p>
<p>Anatolian said Ankara state security court prosecutor Nuh Cetinkaya had concluded preliminary investigations and wanted Yildiz detained, his home and offices searched. But police looking for Yildiz said he had not been seen since late Monday.</p>
<p>The agency quoted Interior Minister Meral Aksener as saying she would act as necessary against the mayor, who belongs to the senior coalition partner, Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan's Welfare Party. A ministry official told Reuters he could be suspended.</p>
<p>Youths dressed as Palestinians pretended to throw stones at Israeli troops in a play at a public hall in Sincan to mark Jerusalem Day, declared an annual day of protest against Israel by late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.</p>
<p>The mayor and the Iranian ambassador spoke on a stage draped with the banners of Fathi Shaqiqi, the late leader of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group, and Imam Moussa Sadr, an influential cleric venerated by many Lebanese Shi'ites. Sadr disappeared while on a trip to Libya in the late 1970s.</p>
<p>The foreign ministry summoned Iran's ambassador, Mohammad-Reza Baqeri, to protest against his role in Jerusalem day. Iran objected to Turkey's protest.</p>
<p>Erbakan, Turkey's first Islamist prime minister, has gone back on promises to scrap a military training accord with Israel that has angered Arab countries and Iran.</p>
<p>But Erbakan has raised the hackles of the secularist wing of his coalition government in recent weeks with plans to build mosques and other Islamist programmes.</p>
<p>Turkey's biggest leftist party said on Tuesday it would file a censure motion against the Islamist-led government to preserve the secular democracy of the country.</p>
