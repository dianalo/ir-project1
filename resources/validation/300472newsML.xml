<p>The New Zealand share market ended firmer on Friday but well off its intraday highs.</p>
<p>&quot;It bounded out of the gates, up 25 on a bit of Wall St euphoria and a bit of follow-through from yesterday,&quot; said John Rattray, director of equities at Ord Minnett.</p>
<p>&quot;Then it wilted, I guess because the fresh orders didn't justify that sort of movement.&quot;</p>
<p>The NZSE-40 Capital Index closed 4.45 points stronger at 2,406.81, well short of its 2,427.14 peak on the day. Market leader Telecom had at one stage reached NZ$7.60, a gain of 15 cents, only to close flat at $7.45.  </p>
<p>Rattray said the firming New Zealand dollar was a negative for equities. &quot;Quite a number of the larger stocks in the index are generating earnings outside New Zealand,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Australasian brewer Lion Nathan, however, posted a three cent gain to $3.60. Chief executive Douglas Myers reiterated a denial he was selling down his stake in the company.</p>
<p>Lion's share price rose 15 cents on Wednesday, driven higher by rumours that U.S. tobacco and food giant Philip Morris was either going to take over the company or was negotiating for the 16 percent stake held by parties associated with Myers.  </p>
<p>&quot;The suggestion still is that there is something going on on the corporate front in Lion which may not result in Myers selling his shareholding,&quot; said Rattray.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe a change in the softdrink area, something along those lines which is a positive for them.&quot; But he cautioned: &quot;That is strictly rumour.&quot;</p>
<p>In the wider market, Summit Gold NL rose three to $0.57 after reporting that tests had confirmed the presence of gold at its Carrick field in Central Otago.</p>
<p>Brokers said the market had enjoyed a good run this week and may weaken when it resumes. -- Matthew Brockett 64 4 4714 272</p>
