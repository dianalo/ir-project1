<p>A Cuban American civil rights group on Wednesday criticized anti-Castro exiles who forced a Miami radio station to stop playing music from Cuba, calling them an intolerant minority who acted &quot;like the Spanish Inquisition.&quot;</p>
<p>The Cuban American Defense League said the action was &quot;another glaring example of intolerance and censorship in our community&quot;.</p>
<p>Tropical 98.3 radio station last week began playing songs by Cuban pop stars such as Los Van Van and Manolin &quot;the Doctor of Salsa,&quot; breaking a taboo by Miami's Spanish-language radio stations on music from the communist-ruled island.</p>
<p>Right-wing stations immediately attacked Tropical and it stopped the music on Monday after receiving a bomb threat and several advertisers canceled spots.</p>
<p>&quot;People should be allowed to listen to what they want. This is a free country. These people behave like the Spanish Inquisition,&quot; Eddie Rodriguez, chairman of the Cuban American Defense League, said at a news conference.</p>
<p>He said playing Cuban music, and the possible payments of royalties, did not violate the U.S. embargo on Cuba because cultural exchanges were exempt from the blockade.</p>
<p>Los Van Van toured the United States at the end of the year, causing a sensation in New York but avoiding Miami because of a possible confrontation.</p>
<p>&quot;Enough is enough,&quot; lawyer Magda Montiel Davis said at the news conference. &quot;We cannot allow big political muscle to comport themselves in this way. The issue is that in this country you have the right to express yourself freely without death threats and bomb threats.&quot;</p>
<p>The incident is the latest of many in which right-wing anti-Castro exiles have intimidated and threatened artists and other people they view as showing sympathy to Cuba or making conciliatory gestures towards the country.</p>
<p>Montiel Davis said she did not believe the right-wing represented the views of most of Miami's Cuban Americans &quot;but a lot of people are scared to speak out because of the consequences&quot;.</p>
<p>She urged people to write to complain to the national headquarters of the companies whose advertisements were pulled, which included Toyota and Lincoln Mercury.</p>
<p>The Cuban American Defense League is an advisory body set up in 1992 to monitor attacks on civil liberties and freedom of expression in south Florida's Hispanic community.</p>
