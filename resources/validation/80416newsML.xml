<headline>FEATURE - BIS expansion underscores role of central banks.</headline>

<p>Central bank governors used to call their finance ministers after a Group of Seven (G7) summit to hear what happened.</p>
<p>Now, finance ministers call central bank governors after the monthly meeting at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in Basle for an update.</p>
<p>While this may not always be the case, it is clear central banks have taken over the lead from governments as the main agents in the global financial markets, leading economists say.</p>
<p>The expansion of the membership of BIS with nine emerging economic powers underscores the key role of central banks and ultimately foreshadows changes to the core of BIS, the Group of 10 (G10) leading industrial nations, economists say.</p>
<p>&quot;BIS is becoming more important as a forum for central banks because central banks are becoming more important,&quot; said Christopher Huhne, managing director of sovereign ratings at European rating agency IBCA.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the board of BIS, made up of G10 central bank governors, invited nine new central banks from Russia, China, India, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Brazil and Mexico to join the 32-member organisation.</p>
<p>&quot;The expansion will give BIS more visibility, clout and legitimacy in a wide number of countries,&quot; said Peter Kenen, professor of economics at Princeton University.</p>
<p>MOVE SYMBOLISES NEW ECONOMIC WORLD ORDER</p>
<p>While the move largely formalises the growing involvement of emerging countries in BIS in recent years, it symbolises the new economic world order and BIS's push to play a key role.</p>
<p>&quot;If BIS had stuck with its previous membership, it would have had a declining influence,&quot; said Morris Goldstein, senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics.</p>
<p>The BIS expansion comes only days before final agreement is expected on boosting emergency credit lines the International Monetary Fund (IMF) can draw on in times of severe crisis.</p>
<p>New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB) should complement the $25 billion of existing credit lines in the General Arrangements to Borrow (GAB) and involve many emerging countries, including new BIS members South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore.</p>
<p>BIS serves as an example of how international organisations must adapt to changing times if they want to remain relevant.</p>
<p>&quot;This will be the form for international financial institutions of the 21st century,&quot; said Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at J.P.Morgan.</p>
<p>The BIS, the IMF and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) are all adapting to the shift in economic power away from Western Europe.</p>
<p>But rather than jostle for power, OECD chief economist Kumiharu Shigehara said all three institutions have roles to play and are now carving out their specific niches.</p>
<p>UNIQUE CHARACTER OF BIS</p>
<p>BIS, the world's oldest international financial institution, has a unique standing among international organisations because it is owned and governed by central banks.</p>
<p>&quot;BIS is the international organisation for central banks. It is the only organisation that is run by and for central banks, where finance ministries don't get to look in,&quot; said Huhne.</p>
<p>Although BIS was founded in 1930 to deal with the German reparations after World War One, its key function was always to serve as a forum for cooperation among central banks.</p>
<p>Cooperation not only takes the form of monthly meetings of central bank governors -- particularly G10 -- but BIS also serves as a hub for discussions among central bankers or supervisors about monetary policy and financial stability.</p>
<p>G10 actually comprises 11 countries. The G7 -- the U.S., Japan, Germany, Canada, Britain, France and Italy -- as well as the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden and Switzerland.</p>
<p>Frequent face-to-face meetings by governors and central bank staff is highly valued by central bankers as creating a level of personal trust that serves them well in times of crises.</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot underestimate the importance of trust and personal relations. That is really what banking is all about, the word of someone,&quot; said Kenen.</p>
<p>Including emerging economies into this exclusive club should strengthen early warning systems and help bankers or supervisors react in a timely fashion to potential trouble spots.</p>
<p>&quot;The new members will take an active role as a way to improve banking and market statistics,&quot; Shigehara said.</p>
<p>Over the years -- notably in the British sterling crises of the 1960s -- the BIS participated in ad hoc assistance to defend speculative attacs on currencies and it was also active in arranging a $10 billion line of credit to Mexico in 1995.</p>
<p>The growing prominence of independent central banks has thrust the BIS further into the spotlight.</p>
<p>In a world of integrated capital markets, movements in exchange rates play a larger role in policy transmission, necessitating a growing need for communication and cooperation among monetary authorities, economists say.</p>
<p>A further implication of the globalisation of international financial markets is the need to integrate the rapidly growing emerging markets in work toward fostering systemic stability.</p>
<p>&quot;You can't have a discussion about international financial markets and crisis management, particularly after Mexico, without emerging economies. Otherwise you get a distorted view of the world,&quot; said Goldstein.</p>
<p>While the expansion of BIS reflects the economic might of emerging nations, the impetus to reach out came from the creation of the European Monetary Instititute (EMI) in 1994, the forerunner to a European Central Bank.</p>
<p>Plans to set up an Asian-style BIS probably added impetus to the expansion to avoid competing institutions.</p>
<p>Since the 1960s BIS has been associated mainly with European issues and provided a host of services, including a secretariat for the committee of EEC central bank governors and became the agent for the European Monetary Cooperation Fund in 1973.</p>
<p>But this work has shifted to EMI in Frankfurt and is likely to encourage Europe's G10 members to speak with a single voice.</p>
<p>&quot;My suspicion is that European central banks would still have individual seats on the BIS board, but clearly speak with one voice in a very enchanced degree,&quot; said Norman Williams, European economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd (BZW).</p>
<p>The decline in the relative wealth and influence of G10 economies and the growing importance of financial systems in emerging countries is likely to put pressure on smaller G10 countries to give up their seat around the table.</p>
<p>&quot;We won't have a situation where the G10 dictates what the standards are,&quot; Goldstein said. &quot;That just won't fly.&quot;</p>
