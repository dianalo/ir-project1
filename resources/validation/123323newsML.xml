<p>Cuba braced on Thursday for the arrival of Hurricane Lili -- upgraded overnight from tropical storm strength -- extending a hurricane emergency order to include wider areas of the country.</p>
<p>The Civil Defence organisation ordered a hurricane emergency in central provinces as well as the western areas of the country, including the capital.</p>
<p>Cuba, slowly emerging from the worst of an economic crisis caused by the collapse of the former Soviet Union, could be badly hurt by the hurricane. At this time of year the key sugar cane crop, a crucial source of foreign exchange, is just two or three months away from being harvested.</p>
<p>State media said that by Thursday morning some 20,000 people had been evacuated from their homes as a precautionary measure. Many were from area of Havana where houses are in poor condition and in danger of collapsing in severe weather.</p>
<p>Some 325 foreign tourists were evacuated to the mainland from Cayo Lago, a small holiday island to the south of Cuba. Nearly 30,000 high school students at boarding schools in the countryside were sent home and all schools in Havana were closed on Thursday, as were some workplaces.</p>
<p>A tropical storm warning and hurricane watch remained in effect for the Cayman Islands. Forecasters said alerts could be issued for the Florida Keys and parts of the Bahamas later on Thursday. Forecasters warned boaters in the Florida Keys to remain in port.</p>
<p>At 11 a.m. EDT (1500 GMT), the centre of Lili was located at latitude 19.9 north, longitude 83.2 west, about 230 miles (370 km) south-southwest of Havana, according to the National Hurricane Centre in Miami.</p>
<p>The storm, with winds of 75 mph (120 kph), was moving to north-northeast at about 9 mph (15 kph) and was expected to continue on that track for the next 24 hours, approaching the south Cuba coast late on Thursday or early on Friday.</p>
<p>Hurricane-force winds extended 25 miles (40 km) from the centre and tropical storm-force winds extended outward up to 140 miles (220 km).</p>
<p>Rainfall up to 12 inches (30 cm) was likely over Cuba, the Cayman Islands and parts of Central America, raising the possibility of life-threatening flash floods and mud slides. Storm surge flooding of three to six feet (1-2 metres) was possible near where the storm crosses mainland Cuba, forecasters said.</p>
<p>Florida officials were continuing to watch the hurricane's path before deciding if evacuations were necessary. &quot;We are in stand-by mode right now,&quot; said Monroe County Sheriff's Office spokesman Greg Artman. &quot;We've told people to prepare but there are no orders for an evacuation as yet.&quot;</p>
<p>Cuban State media said President Fidel Castro was closely following the situation. Vice-president and Defence Minister Raul Castro, the president's younger brother, led a meeting on Wednesday night of Havana authorities to assess preparations.</p>
<p>Citizens in western and central provinces were urged to secure their homes, lay in stocks of drinking water and food and help clear debris from the streets, particularly Havana.</p>
<p>The upgraded Civil Defence order on Thursday meant the provinces under hurricane emergency were Pinar del Rio, Matanzas, Havana, the Isle of Youth, Cienfuegos, Villa Clara, Sancti Spiritus and Ciego de Avila.</p>
<p>So far some 2,500 people had been evacuated from homes in Havana. But Martinez said as many as 62,000 people living in homes in a critical state of decay should be prepared to move.</p>
<p>Authorities were urging farmers to protect crops and livestock. Tobacco workers in Pinar del Rio province reinforced stores where tobacco leaves for cigars are kept.</p>
