<headline>AT&amp;T names R.R. Donnelley chairman new president, COO.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-10-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>AT&amp;T Corp., ending weeks of speculation, said Wednesday that its board elected John R. Walter, chairman of printing company R.R. Donnelley and Sons, as its new president, chief operating officer and heir apparent to chairman Robert E. Allen.</p>
<p>The giant communications company said that Walter, 49, was unanimously elected Tuesday night to the two management posts and as a member of the board, effective Nov. 1.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm confident John Walter brings leadership qualities that will make the new AT&amp;T successful, not only in the hotly contested long-distance market, but across the whole range of rapidly growing communications services,&quot; Allen, 61, said in a statement.</p>
<p>The president and COO posts were left vacant after Alex Mandl resigned in August to head a small, new wireless company, Associated Communications.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T said its board considered a number of candidates but quickly focused on Walter because his track record at Chicago-based Donnelley, the world's largest commercial printer, fit well with the challenges at AT&amp;T.</p>
<p>&quot;He's transformed a large, old-line company challenged by new technologies and changing markets into a tough global competitor. Meeting those challenges is what leading thenew AT&amp;T is all about,&quot; Allen said.</p>
<p>Allen said that starting in January 1998 he and Walter will split the duties of chairman and chief executive, with Walter taking over both posts later that year.</p>
<p>&quot;The board and I have every expectation that John will become chairman and CEO of AT&amp;T,&quot; Allen said.</p>
<p>Walter, who joined R.R. Donnelley in 1969 as a trainee, held numerous positions in the publishing and information company, becoming chairman in 1989.</p>
<p>&quot;During the 10 years of his operational leadership, Donnelley steadily increased revenue, earnings and cash flow in an industry experiencing little growth,&quot; AT&amp;T said in its announcement. &quot;It also transformed itself.&quot;</p>
<p>Today Donnelley is a global leader in managing and distributing information -- from magazines to software disks and on-line services.</p>
<p>&quot;It is no longer simply a printing company,&quot; Walter said in a statement. &quot;It is a customer-focused marketing services company that fully exploits the capabilities of the digital technologies that once threatened it.&quot;</p>
<p>Allen said that Walter's experience transforming Donnelley from a staid printing company to a high technology information provider was just what AT&amp;T was looking for in a new leader to take it into the next century.</p>
<p>&quot;We intend to do more than ride the wave of change transforming this industry,&quot; Allen said. &quot;We will lead it and profit from it.&quot;</p>
<p>AT&amp;T did not indicate how long Allen will retain the CEO post, or whether Walter was in line to succeed him in that position.</p>
<p>Expectations of an early end to Allen's career were heightened when the company warned in September that its earnings would be weaker than expected. AT&amp;T's per-share profits of 84 cents for the third quarter were off 12 percent from 96 cents a year ago, with increased competition and higher marketing expenses hitting its core long-distance phone business, while financial services sank into losses.</p>
<p>Industry analysts had speculated that Allen would surrender the role of chief executive, rather than chairman, to the new candidate and retain his chairmanship until nearer his retirement.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T's stock lost $1.25 to $38.625 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange amid a 35-point slide in the Dow Jones industrial average.</p>
