<p>Up to 150,000 tonnes of copper shipped to Shanghai from the London Metal Exchange (LME) by Chinese traders in 1996 hurt domestic prices, the head of China's largest non-ferrous metals trading firm said on Friday.</p>
<p>The drop in copper prices harmed China's copper smelters but prices could recover by the second quarter of 1997, Liu Yang, president of Oriental Metals (Holdings) Co Ltd told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>&quot;The Chinese market now is not in its normal situation,&quot; Liu said.</p>
<p>China's domestic copper prices usually were led by prices on the Shanghai Metal Exchange, which very closely followed prices on the LME, Liu said.</p>
<p>&quot;Normally, over the past four years, the ratio was about one to 10. For example, if the LME (cash) price was US$2,000 per tonne, then the Shanghai Metal Exchange price would be 20,000 yuan ($2,410), including value-added tax and import taxes,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, over the past three months the price is different, with the LME price higher and the Shanghai price lower. It's not a normal situation,&quot; Liu said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is because of the stocks around Shanghai of copper cathode,&quot; Liu said, estimating the amount at between 100,000 and 150,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>Liu said the copper cathode was partly bought for China's strategic stockpile and partly by Chinese companies.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not saying speculation, but I'm saying they were taking advantage of this movement -- they kept moving out copper cathode from the London LME warehouse until mid-December last year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The decreased stock pushed the LME, especially the cash price, higher, and the backwardation become bigger,&quot; Liu said.</p>
<p>He said most of the cargo was moved into Shanghai's bonded warehouses, totalling about 100,000 to 150,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>&quot;This put pressure on the Shanghai Metal Exchange for that price, and under that pressure the price could not match the normal ratio,&quot; Liu said.</p>
<p>About 80,000 tonnes of that copper had moved through customs but was still kept in warehouses, Liu said, noting that Shanghai's bonded warehouses normally carried a constant supply of about 50,000 tonnes of copper.</p>
<p>&quot;The (Shanghai) price lower than the LME is not a good thing for copper smelters,&quot; Liu said.</p>
<p>He said smelters were selling copper at prices at least 1,000 yuan ($120) per tonne lower by the third quarter of last year, compared to the first half of 1996.</p>
<p>Liu said he thoought China's domestic copper prices would recover by around the second quarter of this year, when some of the stocks will have been consumed, kept in the country's stockpiles or re-exported.</p>
<p>Shanghai's most active April copper contract ended at 21,530 yuan ($2,594) per tonne on Friday, compared to LME three-month delivery copper at $2,270 per tonne on Thursday.</p>
