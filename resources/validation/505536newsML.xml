<p>Union Bank of Switzerland plans to launch India's largest debt fund by a registered foreign institutional investor, a senior bank official said.</p>
<p>UBS said its $350 million debt fund -- which underlined its growing commitment to Asia -- had been approved by the country's regulators and would be launched shortly.</p>
<p>&quot;In three weeks we would like to start bringing the money in. We have already identified one or two borrowers,&quot; Ho-Kee Lim, chairman of UBS in East Asia, told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>Lim, who was in Bombay on Sunday, said UBS also planned to launch an equity fund but declined to give any further details.</p>
<p>&quot;The board of UBS has committed itself openly to East Asia -- Europe is our home base, we want to make Asia our second home base,&quot; Lim said.</p>
<p>Lim, who was in town for the formal launch of UBS's broking business, said the bank planned to upgrade its offices in China and Bangkok.</p>
<p>The Singapore-based banker said he was unfazed by the ongoing political turmoil following the resignation of Indian Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda after his government lost a confidence vote in parliament on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not fair weather friends. We're a shy, low profile organisation but we have done some major deals here,&quot; Lim said.</p>
<p>UBS has helped finance an $800 million cellular phone project by Indian business group the Birlas and U.S. firm AT&amp;T Corp. The bank is financial adviser to a $1.6 billion power project by U.S. firm Cogentrix.</p>
<p>&quot;Our biggest exposures in Asia are Australia and Korea, where we have about a similar investment, followed by India,&quot; Lim said, adding that UBS's India exposure was around $1.0 billion.</p>
<p>Lim said his stockmarket picks for the 1997 calendar year were Thailand, Korea and India.</p>
<p>&quot;I like Thailand and Korea because they have been beaten up quite badly and India because I don't think too many people understand it yet,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said foreign investors in India were always ready to run when events like a change in government occurred and that resulted in the easy availability of undervalued stocks.</p>
<p>Lim said he favoured a managed depreciation of the Indian rupee as the country moved towards free convertibility.</p>
<p>The government has asked the central bank to set up a panel to prepare a &quot;road map&quot; for making the rupee fully convertible on the capital account.</p>
<p>&quot;It's actually cheaper and more efficient for any currency to depreciate gradually because of interest rate differentials rather than having a massive shock now and then,&quot; Lim said.</p>
<p>&quot;Indonesia does it very well. They let the currency depreciate two to three percent a year. It's more orderly, it gives the importers time to adjust and as a result foreign investors ask for less of a premium,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In the last six months, the rupee has appreciated against the dollar on the back of large foreign capital inflows and reduced imports.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of India has sought a gradual depreciation of the local currency by stepping up its dollar purchase price.</p>
<p>&quot;If you give the system a shock of 20 percent every now and then, the timing of which is not clear, then overseas investors and foreign exchange traders will ask for a bigger premium.&quot;</p>
<p>Lim declined to comment on the investor impact of a recent reversal in aviation policy barring foreign airlines from taking stakes in the domestic sector.</p>
<p>A direct casualty of the new rule is a $600 million joint venture of Singapore Airlines and the country's largest business group, Tata Industries.</p>
<p>&quot;You are in the process of deregulation, of becoming more open. There will be people who will fight you, who will have rearguard action,&quot; he said. &quot;I can't speak for Singapore investors but you have got to be very optimistic about India in the long run.&quot;</p>
