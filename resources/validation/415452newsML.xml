<headline>U.S. High Court drops Torchmark settlement case.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-03-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court dismissed Monday an appeal on whether a small group of objectors should be allowed out of a class-action settlement involving Torchmark Corp's Liberty National Life Insurance Co.</p>
<p>Under Alabama state rules, the certification and settlement of a nationwide class-action does not provide for objectors to opt out of the settlement to pursue individual lawsuits.</p>
<p>The case involved a class-action settlement over cancer insurance policies. The lawsuit on behalf of more than 400,000 Liberty policyholders charged the firm starting in 1986 fradulently began a cancer policy exchange program, with agents attempting to persuade policyholders to switch to new policies.</p>
<p>The new policies contained some benefits not included in the old policies, but placed severe new limits on coverage for radiation and chemotheraphy.</p>
<p>The settlement called for the creation of two funds with $4 million, as well as the payment by Liberty of $4.5 million in fees for attorneys representing the plaintiffs.</p>
<p>About 400 objecting class members appealed, saying they have a constitutional right to opt out when the vast majority of class members get no monetary compensation for the release of their claims seeking damages.</p>
<p>The Alabama Supreme Court ruled against them.</p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the case in October, but in Monday's ruling dismissed the appeal because it had been improperly granted. It said the Alabama high court did not address the key federal issue of whether state rules violate the U.S. Constitution.</p>
