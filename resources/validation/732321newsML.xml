<headline>Court rejects Bezeq motion against strike.</headline>
<dateline>TEL AVIV 1997-07-16</dateline>

<p>Thousands of Israeli public-sector workers walked off their jobs for an hour on Wednesday to back striking Bezeq Israel Telecom employees, shutting down Israel's main airport and Israel Radio.</p>
<p>Employees of state-owned Bezeq walked out on Monday to protest the government's failure to inform them in advance of an agreement to sell 12.5 percent of Bezeq to Merrill Lynch for $250 million.</p>
<p>The Tel Aviv District Labour Court later on Wednesday rejected a petition by Bezeq Telecom seeking a back-to-work order against the strikers, Israel Radio reported.</p>
<p>&quot;The strike will continue tomorrow. I very much hope that we will reach another agreement and that the (parliamentary) finance committee will find a way to restore conifdence in the system,&quot; Shlomo Shani, chairman of the trade union department of the Histadrut labour federation, told the radio.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch plans to sell the Bezeq shares to its clients. Israel's parliamentary finance committee is scheduled to meet on Thursday to review the agreement, Israel Radio said.</p>
<p>Shani said workers at Israel's Airports Authority, as well as at state-owned El Al Israel Airlines and Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI), halted work for an hour in support of the Bezeq strike.</p>
<p>&quot;They held an assembly in a hangar at (Tel Aviv's Ben-Gurion) airport. I just returned from there and can say that nothing moved there for an hour,&quot; Shani said.</p>
<p>A work stoppage at the Israeli Broadcasting Authority took Israel Radio off the air between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. (1100 and 1200 GMT).</p>
<p>Shani said other public sector employees were supposed to have participated in the action but he could not confirm how widely the walk-off was observed.</p>
<p>&quot;We are determined not to allow the government to set or change policy (over state-owned firms) without first consulting the workers,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Bezeq employees, fearing privatisation of the company will lead to massive layoffs, said Communications Minister Limor Livnat had promised them that the government would not sell any shares in Bezeq without first consulting them them.</p>
<p>A Bezeq spokesman said the workers should not be striking since their grievance was with the government, not the company.</p>
