<title>UK: Greenpeace occupation of Conoco London office ends.</title>
<headline>Greenpeace occupation of Conoco London office ends.</headline>

<p>Environmental activists occupied the London offices of U.S. oil company Conoco for about four hours Wednesday morning to protest against oil exploration activity in the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>Conoco is a unit of U.S. chemical giant Du Pont Co. It retails gasoline in Britain under the brand name Jet.</p>
<p>Fifteen members of environmental group Greenpeace gained access to the central London office at around 8 a.m., chaining themselves to various parts of the building.</p>
<p>All were removed by police around midday and no damage or injuries were reported, a Conoco spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;They are all out with the exception of three or four who remain on a flat roof adjoining our building,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Other protesters were still picketing the front of the building beneath banners reading, &quot;Stop climate change - No new oil.&quot;</p>
<p>The company won the right to explore for oil in the Atlantic Ocean to the west of the Shetland Islands in Britain's 17th offshore licensing round.</p>
<p>Greenpeace said earlier its activists would not leave the building until Jet gave an assurance that it would not explore for new oil in the deep frontier waters of the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>&quot;Searching for new oil, particularly in one of Europe's most pristine ocean areas, against a backdrop of climate change, is madness,&quot; said campaigner Liz Pratt.</p>
<p>Conoco said it was prepared to discuss the group's concerns but would not do so &quot;under duress.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Conoco's policy is to conduct its activities in a safe and environmentally responsible manner and it will continue to do so,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Greenpeace has made the Atlantic frontier the focus of its climate change campaign in Britain.</p>
<p>Oil companies discovered commercial quantities in deep Atlantic waters five years ago, and first flows from British Petroleum's Foinaven field are expected late this summer.</p>
