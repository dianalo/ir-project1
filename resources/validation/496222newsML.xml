<p>Rebels reached the centre of Zaire's second city Lubumbashi early on Wednesday evening, but gunfire rang out and the Zairean army was reported in control of the airport six km (four miles) to the north, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Laurent Kabila's rebels, wearing dark olive fatigues, black berets and boots, had entered the city from the direction of the Zambian border earlier on Wednesday. Government forces fled before them, abandoning their headquarters to looting.</p>
<p>Local people shouted &quot;Viva Kabila&quot; and &quot;We are Congolese&quot;, referring to Zaire's former name and the one given to rebel-held territory, nearly half of Africa's third largest country.</p>
<p>One man did cartwheels and handstands of joy in the street.</p>
<p>People looted the former army headquarters of food and anything they could carry - cupboards, carpets, and chairs.</p>
<p>Abandoned rocket launchers lay scattered at the base.</p>
<p>A Belgian man, a longtime resident of the city, had surgery for critical wounds from a mortar shell exploding in his garden.</p>
<p>Residents said there had been heavy street battles in the southern suburbs between the rebels and President Mobutu Sese Seko's Special Presidential Division (DSP).</p>
<p>They said the rebels killed a DSP colonel in a fight near Mobutu's residence in the south of Lubumbashi and the DSP fled.</p>
<p>The rebels earlier took control of a hotel near the military headquarters and the surrounding area.</p>
<p>Expatriate sources said that senior Zairean army officers and perhaps several hundred soldiers were holding out at the airport when a plane arrived in the early evening.</p>
<p>An airport source said government troops were still in control there and the jet was due to evacuate a general.</p>
<p>Sources feared the army did not have enough fuel or planes to evacuate its people from the airport from which there was no obvious way out and where fierce fighting is widely expected.</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps they have nowhere to go,&quot; said one western source.</p>
<p>The highest civilian authority in the copper mining centre, Shaba provincial governor Kyungu wa Kumwanza, said earlier that he was waiting at his home for the rebels to contact him.</p>
<p>&quot;If they ask me, I see no reason not to cooperate with them. If the people are happy, I am happy too. And they are happy, they are celebrating,&quot; Kumwanza, appointed two weeks ago by Mobutu, told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>Rebels said they had met fierce resistance some 15 km (10 miles) out of town, after which they had marched in. One commander said he had two wounded men. There had been heavy mortar and gunfire through the early afternoon.</p>
<p>&quot;We are fighters who have come to liberate you,&quot; one rebel soldier told gleeful staff at Karavia, the city's top hotel.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no problem, do not be afraid, we are here to protect you,&quot; he said to applause and smiles from doormen and waiters. He spoke Swahili, the lingua franca of central Africa, but not much French, the national language of Zaire.</p>
<p>The staff provided red soda pop to quench the thirst of the more than a dozen rebels lined up around the hotel.</p>
<p>They wore white headbands from ripped up tablecloths, a symbol of support for Kabila's Alliance of Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire which now controls all major cities but the edgy capital, Kinshasa, 1,800 km (1,200 miles) away.</p>
<p>The hotel staff first donned their white bandannas on Monday as news spread that rebels had taken Kipushi on the Zambian border, a mere 30 km (20 miles) away.</p>
<p>Some of the city's soldiers changed sides the same day.</p>
<p>The staff stuffed their bands back into their pockets when it became clear the rebels were being held up by diehard members of the DSP, who had been flown in and ordered to fight.</p>
<p>Gloom had spread across Lubumbashi on Tuesday as it became clear that the rebels would not sail into town unopposed.</p>
<p>People in the crowd said many soldiers had stripped off their uniforms and dumped them before fleeing the rebel advance.</p>
<p>Electricity and the city's main cellular telephone network, both of which went off in previous battles for cities, were still working in Lubumbashi even after the rebels came.</p>
