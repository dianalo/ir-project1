<p>Dollar/mark looks poised for a trend reversal over the medium term after a rally to a modest new high above 1.74 quickly fizzled on Friday, analysts said.</p>
<p>The dollar lacked upside momentum as it rose to a 39-month high at 1.7423 marks. If the subsequent decline leaves it in negative territory for the day, it could signal a change in trend or at least some sort of deeper correction, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;We've seen the top at 1.7420 this morning. I think we started the correction that will probably take us down to 1.7150 (marks) early next week,&quot; said Martin Autotte, technical analyst at CIBC Wood Gundy in Montreal.  </p>
<p>&quot;If it were to move below 1.71 marks, it would be a serious cause for concern for the bullish scenario,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Friday's dollar advance left in its wake the fourth of a series of new highs since March. But analysts said they were disappointed by the slim margin by which the dollar exceeded its previous high of 1.7389 on set on April 28.</p>
<p>Analysts also said a major cause for worry was that the dollar's new high against the mark did not come in tandem with new peaks in dollar/yen or dollar/Swiss.  </p>
<p>&quot;This is the first new high that you've had in dollar/mark not confirmed by any other dollar pair,&quot; said Darren Spain, global foreign exchange analyst at Credit Suiss First Boston.</p>
<p>A drop below 1.7175 marks should be used to add to short dollar positions as the decline accelerates, Spain said, adding that he sees a sharp move lower next week with potential for the dollar to near the 1.66 mark region again this month.</p>
<p>Intermediate support for the dollar lies at 1.7220/30 marks, where the retreat ended on Friday, chartists said.  </p>
<p>Dollar/yen was shoved out of bed as the dollar tumbled against the mark Friday.</p>
<p>Now that it has shaken off the confines of its two-week-long consolidation between 115 and 117, there is potential for dollar/yen to breach Friday's low at 114.50.</p>
<p>But that prop represents the 50-percent retracement of the rise from 111.98 yen on May 20 to 117 yen on May 28, and could prove durable in the short-term, analysts said.</p>
