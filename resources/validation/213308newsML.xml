<p>Wall Street stocks were broadly higher at Monday's midsession, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average crossing the 6500 level for the first time.</p>
<p>The Dow rose 31 points to 6503, piercing the 6500 level just moments before midday. Stocks were paced by strong gains in the energy and financial sectors.</p>
<p>&quot;The financials are really leading this market today,&quot; said Guy Truicko, portfolio manager at Unity Management. &quot;The bond market has laid a nice foundation.&quot; </p>
<p>Dow component J.P. Morgan &amp; Co Inc rose 1-1/4 to 91-5/8. Citicorp climbed two points to 108-1/2 and Chase Manhattan Corp added 2-5/8 to stand at 94-1/8.</p>
<p>U.S. Treasuries registered solid gains, with long-term bonds showing the strongest advance. The 30-year bond rose 9/32, pushing the yield down to 6.42 percent.</p>
<p>Stocks got off to a shaky start, edging lower in the initial moments of trade as investors took profits after Friday's rally. However, the Dow quickly reversed course and by late morning broader indices had followed suit. </p>
<p>Analysts cited growing confidence about low inflation and a solid showing by the dollar also helped stocks and bonds.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a growing feeling that the low interest rate and low inflation environment scenario could continue well into 1997,&quot; said Alan Ackerman, market strategist at Fahnestock &amp; Co. &quot;The strong dollar will also help to focus foreign investors on U.S. markets.&quot;</p>
<p>A report this morning from the National Association of Realtors showed existing home sales fell to an annual rate of 3.97 million units in October from 4.03 million in September, a slightly steeper decline than expected. </p>
<p>Economists said the report on the housing sector is considered to be a leading indicator for the overall economy and may indicate growth should remain tepid for the near term, which would be bullish for the bond market.</p>
<p>Among individual stocks, PanEnergy Corp gained 1-5/8 to 43-7/8 after agreeing to merge with Duke Power Co for a total of $7.7 billion in stock. Duke Power fell 1-3/4 to 46-1/8.</p>
<p>Oil companies Texaco Inc and Exxon Corp climbed amid reports the United Nations was close to a deal that would allow Iraq to resume oil exports. </p>
<p>The news failed to elicit much of a response in oil markets, however, where traders said strong fundamentals and a favorable weather outlook outweighed worries about the possible pricing pressure that would result from the re-introduction of Iraqi supplies.</p>
<p>Chiron Corp fell 3-1/4 to 18-5/8 after the company announced clinical tests failed to show its vaccine for general herpes was effective.</p>
