<p>Thai stocks finished down 2.17 percent in moderate trade after investors sold stocks across the board on worries about the country's economic problems while they also awaited the makeup of a new government, brokers said.</p>
<p>The SET index dropped 20.81 points to 938.42 on 4.6 billion baht turnover. The SET-50 index retreated 1.84 points to 71.65.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors sold stocks on their concerns of a drop in the country's exports just announced by the central bank. They were also awaiting the announcement of a new cabinet,&quot; said Thanawat Patchimkul of Seamico Securities.  </p>
<p>The Bank of Thailand said just before the market resumed trading in the afternoon that Thailand's exports in September were valued at 112.5 billion baht compared to 117.7 billion baht in August and 126.2 billion a year ago.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors are also not impressed that some inefficient members of parliament might become ministers in the new cabinet being formed now,&quot; said Thanawat.</p>
<p>Newly appointed Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh is finalising his cabinet that is expected to be announced over the weekend.  </p>
<p>All the key sectors declined today.</p>
<p>National Finance and Securities retreated five baht to 61.50 while Krung Thai Bank dropped two to 74.50 and large capitalised TelecomAsia slipped 1.50 to 54.</p>
<p>Siam Cement, which announced a moderate 13.8 percent rise in its third quarter profit on Wednesday, closed down 20 baht at 852.</p>
<p>Support is seen by some brokers at 910 points and resistance at 950 on Friday.</p>
