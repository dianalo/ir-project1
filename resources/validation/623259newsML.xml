<p>A Russian reformer will become head of Russia's largest company, national power utility UES, on Friday as government leaders complete the takeover of their first major target for market reform.</p>
<p>But a new team at the top of Unified Energy System will not wish away a snarl of debts and non-market structures which have strangled the power industry for decades.</p>
<p>Regional utilities and producers promised greater freedom will look to the meeting for evidence that UES will give them some independence in exchange for competing with each other.</p>
<p>Boris Brevnov, a home-town ally of first deputy prime minister and monopoly reformer Boris Nemtsov, will become chief executive and a committee of government representatives headed by Nemtsov will pack the board when Russia votes its controlling UES stake.</p>
<p>Brevnov's arrival signalled a more shareholder-friendly style at UES.</p>
<p>Earlier this month it launched an issue of Global Depositary Receipts, share look-alikes snapped up by investors who have driven UES shares to about $0.31 currently from eight cents in December.</p>
<p>The government owns 52.7 percent of UES, a legacy from communist days and security concerns, but market-oriented officials are using their control to push through change at the top. Foreigners hold 28 percent, Brevnov's office said.</p>
<p>Nemtsov has said he expects lower electricity prices for industrial users by mid-summer, but says the whole process will take years. Industrial users have been choked by prices higher than those of heavily subsidised households, who are major debtors to utilities.</p>
<p>&quot;To create this market sensibly, without destroying the whole system, is an extremely difficult task for the state,&quot; he said last week.</p>
<p>Brevnov and government allies must plot a careful course, part of which will be outlined on Friday, between controlling reform from the top and fostering competition by breaking down UES's control over subsidiaries in every area of the industry.</p>
<p>UES, Russia's largest company by sales, owns and operates the national electricity transmission grid, operates 27 of Russia's 34 largest power plants and has stakes of 49 percent or more in 70 of 72 regional power utilities.</p>
<p>Brevnov and Nemtsov have said they are keen to create a competitive national wholesale electricity market by loosening the link beween power production and transmission, both of which are part of RAO Yedinaya Energeticheskaya Sistema Rossii (UES).</p>
<p>UES has already said it plans to cut its tariffs to industrial users by 13 percent this year though some UES officials have said such cuts may not be possible -- evidence of division between the new and old guards.</p>
<p>Company officials including Brevnov, who was drafted into UES by Nemtsov on April 1 to represent the government, have generally kept quiet on proposals to decrease regional utilities' dependence on UES, in part by issuing new shares.</p>
<p>Government officials have promised not to break up UES.</p>
<p>Reformers aim to eliminate a multi-billion dollar backlog in payments between energy producers, customers and fuel suppliers and change the payments structure of power transmission between customers on a national wholesales electricity market.</p>
<p>&quot;It is going to be a very difficult process,&quot; said Deutsche Morgan Grenfell research director Jim Nail.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope Brevnov and other reformers are not underestimating the difficulty,&quot; he said. &quot;The non-payments crisis is not something that can be eliminated overnight. It can begin soon, but I think we are looking at a total of three-five years.&quot;</p>
