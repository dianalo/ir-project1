<p>After the storm a rare calm is set to embrace Italian soccer at the weekend.</p>
<p>It needs it. In the past year the country has suffered deep disappointment at international level while sitting through the first strike by millionaire serie A players.</p>
<p>Antonio Matarrese, the vice-president of soccer's world governing body FIFA, was ousted as Italian federation (FIGC) chairman in August by members who then failed to agree on a replacement.</p>
<p>A special commissioner, Raffaele Pagnozzi, was hastily appointed to run the federation temporarily in only the fourth such move in Italy's footballing history since 1898.</p>
<p>And Italy currently has a national team without a coach after Arrigo Sacchi jumped -- probably before he was pushed -- to return to his old club AC Milan last week.</p>
<p>By Monday, many of the problems should be resolved, ironically with some old faces in new roles.</p>
<p>League president Luciano Nizzola, a 63-year-old lawyer from Turin, looks certain to become the new FIGC chairman in an election on Saturday that also paves the way for the appointment of a new national coach to replace Sacchi.</p>
<p>The popular under-21 coach Cesare Maldini, father of Italy defender Paolo, is expected to get Sacchi's job. An announcement is likely soon after Nizzola's election.</p>
<p>At the same time, in a sign of general harmony in the upper echelons of Italian soccer, Nizzola's new deputy chairman is set to be serie C president Giancarlo Abete.</p>
<p>Abete challenged Nizzola for the main job at the last election in August, when Matarrese was voted out following Italy's poor showing in the Euro '96 tournament and widespread anger at his renewal of Sacchi's contract until 1998.</p>
<p>Nizzola is in turn expected to be replaced at the league by Franco Carraro, a former minister, ex-mayor of Rome and ex-president of the Italian Olympic Committee.</p>
<p>Carraro has also been targeted by none other than FIFA head Joao Havelange as a possible successor to him.</p>
<p>&quot;I am very optimistic,&quot; the head of Italy's Olympic committee (CONI) Mario Pescante said this week.</p>
<p>&quot;I think stability at least is ensured. The election on December 14 is an election for stability, both within Italian soccer and in its relations with CONI where there have previously been some tensions.&quot;</p>
<p>Soccer, through the Totocalcio pools system, provides the funding in Italy for the Olympic committee.</p>
<p>Pescante said that Nizzola, Matarrese's sidekick when the FIFA vice-president ran the league before moving on to the helm of the FIGC, was the man to restore calm.</p>
<p>&quot;He is what we call an 'institutional&quot; personality',&quot; Pescante said. &quot;He's not well known as a president of a club or as a fan and in any case he is a lawyer by profession.&quot;</p>
<p>Matarrese was closely linked to southern club Bari, where his brother Vincenzo is president.</p>
<p>Nizzola, the longest serving league president in Italian soccer history after nine years in the job, has no playing background and first made his mark in the sport when he joined Torino as a board member in 1981.</p>
<p>In 1983 he became club managing director before joining the league the following year as vice-president.</p>
<p>Married but without children, Nizzola works four days a week for the league. &quot;He is totally devoted to soccer, soccer, soccer&quot; a league source said when asked about his personality.</p>
<p>&quot;I think he will be much more of a team player. With Matarrese things were centralised, with Nizzola things will be more de-centralised,&quot; said Pescante. &quot;That is the change.&quot;</p>
<p>The other big change is a return to the old ways, with insiders brought up in the system favoured over personalities such as Sacchi recruited from the club ranks.</p>
<p>Pescante said there had been discussions about whether the national coach should be recruited from a club or groomed within the FIGC, as was the case with Maldini, a 64-year-old former international captain turned FIGC coach.</p>
<p>&quot;I think Maldini would be a good candidate for that reason. I have to admit that I am a fan of his,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Maldini -- as similar to Sacchi as chalk to cheese -- would be a popular choice, if not the most popular.</p>
<p>He won the European under-21 championship three times as a coach and served as assistant to Enzo Bearzot whose team brought the 1982 World Cup back to Italy.</p>
<p>As a player he led AC Milan to victory in the 1963 European Cup, beating Portugal's Benfica 2-1. The same Milan team included Giovanni Trapattoni, the Bayern Munich coach who tops most polls as the &quot;people's choice&quot; to replace Sacchi.</p>
<p>Unlike Sacchi, who never played professionally and whose working life began as a shoe salesman, Maldini won four league titles as a Milan player in the 1950s and 60s.</p>
<p>His career included spells with some greats of the game, including Sweden's Nils Liedholm and Gunnar Nordahl.</p>
<p>Significantly, almost all the players in the current Italian team have emerged from his under-21 ranks.</p>
<p>He would also be cheaper than former World Cup winning captain Dino Zoff, the other main candidate.</p>
<p>The final decision rests with Nizzola and it should be one of the easier tasks he faces.</p>
<p>&quot;Naming a coach is not difficult,&quot; said Pescante. &quot;Getting rid of one is a much tougher decision. He (Nizzola) has one problem less already.&quot;</p>
