<title>ITALY: Italian euthanasia doctor kills himself, son says.</title>
<headline>Italian euthanasia doctor kills himself, son says.</headline>
<dateline>FIESOLE, Italy 1997-05-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>A doctor who championed the right of Italian women to have abortions and subsequently promoted euthanasia has killed himself, his son said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Giorgio Conciani, 67, was found hanging on Monday night at his home in the Tuscan town of Fiesole, near Florence.</p>
<p>&quot;I expected this at any time. He had often said that he would kill himself and I believe that a man's ideas should be respected,&quot; Conciani's son, Ferruccio, 28, said. He added that his father had been suffering from a debilitating illness.</p>
<p>Conciani had spent his life promoting the right to abortion in Italy, a country where the powerful Roman Catholic church considers it a sin, and also championed euthanasia.</p>
<p>He was briefly imprisoned in 1975 for performing illegal abortions and was struck off as a practising doctor in 1995 after being accused of helping a terminally ill patient to die by administering a cocktail of lethal drugs.</p>
<p>Abortion now is legal in Italy but euthanasia is still outlawed.</p>
<p>Ferruccio Conciani said his father hanged himself because he believed it was a more certain way of dying. &quot;In any case, his illness prevented him from going to the chemist,&quot; he added.</p>
