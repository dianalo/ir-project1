<headline>&quot;No computers, please!&quot; prize-winning writer says.</headline>

<p>Colombian poet and novelist Alvaro Mutis, who won Spain's top literary prize on Friday, is a self-described ignoramus who still writes on an ageing typewriter and shuns computers.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not interested in them at all. I don't want to know anything about computers or the Internet. I'm an integral ignoramus,&quot; Mutis said.</p>
<p>Mutis, born in Bogota in 1923, was speaking in a telephone interview with Colombia's Caracol radio network from his home in Mexico City. He said he was woken up before dawn by a caller anxious to tell him he had just won Spain's prestigious Principe de Asturias literary award.</p>
<p>&quot;I wasn't expecting the prize but I appreciate it immensely,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Mutis is a contemporary and friend of fellow Colombian exile and Nobel Prize-winner Gabriel Garcia Marquez, who has said he began working on a computer several years ago and finds that it facilitates the writing process immensely.</p>
<p>Mutis, whose work is little known in English, said he would stick with the typewriter on which he has been writing for at least 25 years.</p>
<p>But in a small concession to technology, he acknowledged that the typewriter is electric, not manual.</p>
