<headline>N.Y. seen appealing ruling on reservation taxes.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-09-10</dateline>

<p>New York state, which was given a deadline to start collecting taxes on cigarettes and gasoline sold by Native Americans on reservations, plans to appeal the court's ruling, the plantiffs' lawyer said Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We've been informed they will serve it,&quot; said David Cherubin, of Crane, Kelley, Green &amp; Parente in Albany, referring to the one-page notice of appeal he said the state has told him it plans to file this week.</p>
<p>The attorney represents about 3,000 convienence stores, located throughout New York state, who sued the state to require it to collect the taxes, saying its failure to do so gives the reservations an unfair competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Stores located within 30 miles of the reservations are being undercut on the prices they charge by more than 20 cents per gallon of gasoline, he says, adding some reservations sell cigarettes for as low as $5.60 a carton.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the state attorney general was not immediately available to comment.</p>
<p>State Supreme Court Judge Joseph Harris in his mid-August decision gave the state 120 days to begin collecting the taxes.</p>
<p>Court sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, have said that the Pataki Administration is reluctant to collect the taxes, partly because it fears a few Native Americans might strongly protest the action, perhaps violently.</p>
<p>Further, there is speculation that Gov. George Pataki might wish to use the issue as a bargaining chip in talks on casinos and land disputes.</p>
<p>While New York will get an automatic stay of the 120-day deadline once it appeals the decision, Cherubin said he plans to ask the court to allow the deadline to remain in effect.</p>
