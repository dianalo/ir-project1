<headline>Bayer sees deal boosting U.S. OTC business.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-09-16</dateline>

<p>Bayer AG said on Monday the addition of two drugs gained in a joint-venture deal with Roche Holding AG would add &quot;at least&quot; $200 million to Bayer's U.S. over-the-counter drug business in 1997.</p>
<p>The venture will include Roche's Aleve analgesic and Femstat 3 for vaginal yeast infections.</p>
<p>Bayer's U.S. consumer care division had sales of about $600 million in 1995, unit president Gary Balkema said.</p>
<p>&quot;The addition of Aleve and Femstat 3 is projected to add at least $200 million next year, taking us to beyond $800 million,&quot; he said in a conference call.  </p>
<p>A Bayer spokesman in Germany said total sales of the joint venture, which will include Bayer's Actron and Vanquish analgesics, Midol menstrual pain reliever and Mycelex-7 vaginal yeast infection treatment, will be about $275 million in its early years.</p>
<p>The venture does not include Bayer asprin or other Bayer brands including Alka-Seltzer, One-A-Day and Flintstones vitamins.</p>
<p>Balkema said the deal will move Bayer into the No. 3 spot among U.S. OTC health care companies, behind Johnson and Johnson and American Home Products Corp.  </p>
<p>He said that prior to the deal, Bayer stood at about No. 6.</p>
<p>&quot;Our intent is to build both internally and externally to be one of the premier players here in the U.S.,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Balkema said Bayer expected Aleve to face generic, private-label competition starting in early 1997 in the U.S.</p>
<p>&quot;We're expecting that (and) we'll obviously keep that in mind during our marketing efforts for next year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said Bayer had not made any decisions &quot;in the long term&quot; on advertising agencies for the joint venture.  </p>
<p>&quot;Obviously our first priority is to work with the current agency lineup and continue to have what we're calling a seamless transition,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Earlier, Bayer and Roche said the deal needed cartel authority approval.</p>
