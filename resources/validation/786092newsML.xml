<p>Reed Elsevier co-chairman Herman Bruggink said on Thursday the Anglo-Dutch professional publisher expects to see a meaningful contribution to earnings from its ongoing investments in electronic publishing from 1999 or 2000.</p>
<p>&quot;We should see a real contribution in terms of what we have invested and what we get back beginning in two to three years,&quot; Bruggink told a presentation on the group's first-half results.</p>
<p>Earlier on Thursday Reed Elsevier reported that first-half pre-tax profit rose just one percent to 419 million sterling, saying underlying profit growth was good but that the pound's strength had dented reported earnings.</p>
<p>Bruggink said a high level of investment in on-line delivery mechanisms, particularly Internet-based systems, had also curtailed earnings growth.</p>
<p>Investment in major electronic publishing projects rose to 28 million guilders in the first half of 1997 from 20 million a year earlier and was charged to the profit and loss account.</p>
<p>Reed Elsevier warned in March that such investment would &quot;constrain historical rates of margin improvement&quot; temporarily but should be rewarded in the future by strong revenue growth.</p>
<p>Bruggink and executive committee member Paul Vlek said they were convinced that electronic media added value and greater functionality to Reed Elsevier's content and that customers would eventually be won over by these advantages.</p>
<p>Bruggink said a recent five-year deal with Microsoft would give Reed Elsevier an important commercial advantage in the form of access to new Microsoft Internet information delivery systems before their full commercial launch.</p>
<p>He said new online product, Air Transport Intelligence, launched in June, used a version of the Microsoft Commercial Internet Systems (MCIS) suite which will not be released until September, giving Reed Elsevier a four-month head start.</p>
<p>Bruggink said Reed Elsevier's scientific publishing division had completed the development phase of its Internet-based Science Direct online publishing project and was now loading the content of its journals, starting with Life Sciences.</p>
<p>Science Direct was now in a trial phase with some 30 institutions receiving the service for free.</p>
<p>A subscription fee would be charged from late 1997 or early 1998, based on the subscription already paid for hard-copy journals plus a supplement for the electronic facility.</p>
<p>Bruggink said the content of all the Life Science journals would be loaded by the end of the year and all of the group's scientific journals within a couple of years.</p>
<p>Reed Elsevier's online information service for the travel industry TravelNet was launched in July and will compete with a service set up earlier by Microsoft and American Express.</p>
<p>For manufacturers, Reed Elsevier launched an Internet-based service called Manufacturing Marketplace in March.</p>
<p>Bruggink said this was not yet generating a great deal of revenue but would be strengthened by the recently announced acquisition of U.S. business publisher Chilton, which adds 14 manufacturing trade journals to Reed Elsevier unit Cahners' 15.</p>
<p>Manufacturing Marketplace competes with Industry.net, operated by Nets Inc, an Internet commerce company which filed in May for Chapter 11 protection under U.S. bankruptcy law.</p>
