<p>The Philippine stock market fell below the 3,000 support level on Monday in its worst tailspin in six months virtually driving out prospects of a bull run during the year, analysts said.</p>
<p>Blue chips broke their key supports, losers overwhelmed gainers 133 to 17 and all indices dropped, with the property and banking sectors taking the biggest battering.</p>
<p>The 30-company main index hit a day low of 2,979.62 points before closing at 2,990.96, down 69.63 points or 2.28 percent, in its biggest single-day drop since October 8 last year when it fell by 83.49 points.</p>
<p>&quot;The (market) is far from a bust but we have given up on a bull run this year,&quot; said Joey Salceda, director at SBC Warburg, a unit of Swiss Banking Corp.</p>
<p>Continued nervousness over an anticipated increase in U.S. interest rates in the next few months combined with other factors brought renewed turmoil to a market that had lost about 200 points in less than two weeks, analysts said.</p>
<p>Louie Bate, managing director for Equities Brokerage Trading of ING Baring Securiies Phlippines Inc, said the only factor that might help the market pull out of its slump in the near term was an oversold situation or a technical rally.</p>
<p>&quot;Once the earnings come out, then obviously it could help the market sustain its rally,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Besides concern over U.S. rate hikes, the market remains generally weak in the absence of any buy incentives, research director Helen Alvarez of All Asia Securities Management Corp said.</p>
<p>She said she expected the market to stay weak for the next several days before one could hope for a rebound.</p>
<p>&quot;It was really a bloodbath,&quot; said Raymond Garcia, president at Diversified Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;(Some) foreign brokerage firms put the Philippine market on their negative list,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Absence of foreign funds, a chief market propeller, has also helped depress the market, said Joel Santillan, research head of Asiamerit Securities Inc.</p>
<p>&quot;I think they will wait for the dust to settle not just in this market but also abroad,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Traders said foreign investors were concerned over the state of the Philippine property and banking sectors, and the lack of a clear successor to President Fidel Ramos in 1998.</p>
<p>The Manila Stock Exchange property sub-index dropped 77.86 points, or 5.27 percent, to 1,399.38.</p>
<p>Other traders said negative reports of rising auto loans and credit cards in local banks and the Victorias Milling Corp loan crisis fuelled fears on the lending prudence of local banks.</p>
<p>&quot;There is now a cloud hanging over the banking sector due to the so-called defaults piling up in the credit card and consumer loans,&quot; Astro del Castillo, research analyst at A &amp; A Securities said.</p>
<p>A foreign securities firm said some banks were facing default rates of over 12 percent in auto loans alone.</p>
<p>Leading declines were Metropolitan Bank and Trust Co which fell 30 pesos to 640 pesos, Equitable Banking Corp which slid one peso to 114 pesos, and Philippine National Bank, which slipped 15 pesos to 290 pesos.</p>
<p>But Central Bank managing director for research Amando Tetangco said in a recent local television interview the latest survey on credit card and auto debt had so far not raised any red flags on the number of defaults.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not think that the level of consumer lending has reached alarming levels,&quot; he said. Results of the survey should be out in the next few months.</p>
<p>The three banks were among the top 10 most heavily traded issues on Monday.</p>
