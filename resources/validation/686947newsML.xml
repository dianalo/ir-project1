<p>The U.S. Supreme Court, in a ruling that could affect the historic tobacco settlement, refused Wednesday to uphold a settlement between asbestos manufacturers and an estimated 100,000 people who claimed they were injured by the once widely used substance.</p>
<p>In a defeat for 20 former asbestos companies, the justices upheld a U.S. appeals court decision that threw out the $1.3 billion settlement because the interests of the various plaintiffs were too diverse and too much in conflict to meet the definition of a class-action lawsuit under federal court rules.</p>
<p>The high court's vote in the case was 6-2.</p>
<p>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote for the majority that the class-action asbestos case failed in several critical respects to satisfy a rule of federal civil procedure concerning a global settlement of current and future claims.</p>
<p>The case had been closely watched because the ruling could have implications for last week's $368.5 billion settlement between the tobacco industry and U.S. states.</p>
<p>However, there are a number of differences between the asbestos case and the tobacco settlement. The case involved a proposed court settlement under federal rules while the tobacco deal would become effective through legislation Congress must approve and the president must sign.</p>
<p>Ginsburg pointedly noted that Congress had not adopted a nationwide claims processing system to compensate victims of asbestos exposure.</p>
<p>The asbestos ruling still may make it harder to reach an overall federal court settlement as a way of handling mass tort liability claims.</p>
<p>Other mass tort cases in recent years have involved the Dalkon Shield birth control device, the Agent Orange chemical defoliant used in the Vietnam Var, silicone breast implants and defective heart valves.</p>
<p>The proposed asbestos settlement was reached in 1993 by lawyers for a group of people exposed to the material and 20 firms that had stopped making asbestos products around 1975, including Armstrong World Industries Inc., Union Carbide Corp., Dana Corp. and Pfizer Inc..</p>
<p>The settlement would have provided a range of payments for those who made claims after the case was filed and who met certain criteria for medical ailments and exposure to asbestos, which has been linked to cancer and other illnesses.</p>
<p>The proposed settlement set caps on the amount of money an individual victim may recover and on how many claims may be paid out in a year. An estimated 100,000 people would have received payments over a 10-year period.</p>
<p>The settlement did not provide any payments for those who had been exposed to asbestos but are not yet sick, although it did remove the statute of limitations on when they could file claims.</p>
<p>Reading a summary of her opinion from the bench, Ginsburg agreed with the appeals court's reasoning in throwing out the settlement.</p>
<p>&quot;The complaint delineated no subclasses; it did not separate persons currently suffering no asbestos-related disease from so-called 'exposure-only' plaintiffs, persons who have not yet manifested any asbestos-related condition,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Ginsburg concluded that it would be inappropriate to lump the interests of both groups &quot;into a single mass class.&quot;</p>
<p>She added, &quot;The exhaustive settlement agreement stops nearly all persons fitting the class description from ever litigating claims&quot; against the former asbestos firms.</p>
<p>To qualify for class certification, four conditions must be met under federal court rules, including that the parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the group and common questions of law or fact must predominate, Ginsburg said.</p>
<p>She said federal courts cannot disregard the criteria and simply hold that if a settlement is &quot;fair&quot; then certification is proper.</p>
<p>Justice Stephen Breyer, joined by Justice John Paul Stevens, dissented.</p>
<p>Among his objections, Breyer said the need for settlement in the case appeared greater than what the opinion suggested, and he added that he was uncertain about the tenor of the ruling suggesting that the settlement had been unfair.</p>
<p>He also said it was inappropriate for the high court to second-guess the fact findings of the federal judge who had initially approved the settlement.</p>
