<headline>Med oil products mixed, markets fairly quiet.</headline>

<p>Mediterranean oil products were mixed on Friday, traders said.</p>
<p>Petrogal said its Sines refinery would shut down for maintenance from September 11 to October 21.</p>
<p>Gasoline prices remained easy with stocks still looking generally long despite lower production levels as refiners miximise on more profitable distillate production.</p>
<p>Traders said the market was underpinned by stronger crude, but lengthy supplies and poor demand, kept sentiment bearish.</p>
<p>Naphtha talked steady in quiet trade supported by crude and with sellers levels holdings stable amid limited avails.  </p>
<p>A trader was heard offering a late September loading Algerian cargo at a steady $205 cif Med.</p>
<p>Low sulphur fuel oil was weaker. A large Italian end user bought a 30,000 tonne cargo loading in Antwerp next week at $106 fob ARA. This deal surprised many traders, who saw a high sulphur cargo sold to a trader, who needs to cover commitments into the latest Portuguese tender, out of ARA at $109 fob NWE.</p>
<p>The trader was heard now holding at least five cargoes for the tender, and was thought to need between one and three more.</p>
<p>The trader was heard having bought an Italian cargo on Thursday but the price was not known.  </p>
<p>Another dealer, who bought a mid-month Italian cargo last week at fob high +$1.25, was heard having sold it at +$1.50.</p>
<p>A further trader was offered a 50,000 tonne low sulphur cargo, Oct arrival, at $117 cif Italy.</p>
<p>Gas oil was firm, but high prices subdued the market.</p>
<p>Two Russian cargoes were on offer. Premiums were put at quotes cif high +$2.0/+$2.50. Turkish and Greek demand was seen lending support to 0.2 percent material.</p>
<p>French refiners were also reported to be looking for FOD cargoes to the Med, although no deals are reported.</p>
