<p>Hong Kong stocks were sharply lower in Friday morning trade, under pressure from overnight drops in U.S. stocks and bonds, analysts said.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng index was down 96.46 points at 11,231.75. Turnover was HK$3.84 billion after the first fifty minutes of trade, boosted by a New World Development share placement.</p>
<p>&quot;The fall today is on the back of Wall Street but I think the market is really in a trading range,&quot; said Howard Gorges, director at South China Brokerage.</p>
<p>The Dow industrials fell 64.73 points on Thursday to 5,647.65 and the U.S. long bond dropped 23/32 to yield 7.04 percent following stronger than expected economic data.</p>
<p>Gorges said the local market was &quot;behaving fairly normally&quot; following a rise of about six percent in the Hang Seng index this month.</p>
<p>&quot;It pushed up towards the high end of the range during  last week and there was no way that it was going to push through, I don't think, having seen an 800 point rise from the low,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think people are betting on an interest rate increase in the short term,&quot; he said, adding that the strong U.S. economic data had just affected sentiment.</p>
<p>James Osborn, sales director at ING Barings, said the market was going through the process of turning 11,200 points on the Hang Seng into a support level from a resistance level.</p>
<p>&quot;The whole process we are seeing at the moment is that the market is going to settle back into the 11,200 to 11,600 range it was in before the summer. There is a bit of buying around 11,200,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Shares in New World Development resumed trading on Friday after Thursday afternoon's suspension and fell HK$0.50 to HK$37.50. The company placed 75 million existing shares at HK$37.10 each.</p>
<p>Qingling Motors fell HK$0.10 to HK$2.95 while Silver Grant rose HK$0.04 to HK$1.90. Silver Grant sold 80 million Qingling shares to institutional investors at HK$2.975 per share.</p>
<p>First Pacific and Henderson Investment joined the Hang Seng index on Friday. First Pacific shares fell HK$0.10 to HK$12.75 and Henderson Investment was down HK$0.10 at HK$8.40.</p>
<p>Trading in Top Form was suspended at the company's request pending an announcement. The shares closed at HK$0.275 on Thursday.</p>
