<title>PHILIPPINES: No fraud, says family of Filipino Bre-X geologist.</title>
<headline>No fraud, says family of Filipino Bre-X geologist.</headline>

<p>The family of Michael de Guzman said on Monday that the late Filipino geologist for Bre-X Minerals Ltd would never commit fraud despite findings that the Busang gold strike in Indonesia was falsified.</p>
<p>&quot;Let us shout to the whole world that my brother has never been involved in any kind of fraudulent acts or scam and he will never do anything that will jeopardise the integrity of the Filipinos in Indonesia,&quot; said de Guzman's brother, Simplicio.</p>
<p>In a stunning report to Bre-X, consultant Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd said data used to tout Busang as the richest find this century was falsified on a scale &quot;without precedent in the history of mining anywhere in the world&quot;.</p>
<p>Strathcona said it had found evidence of tampering with Bre-X core samples taken from the Busang site, located deep in the Borneo jungle. It did not say who it thought may have been responsible.</p>
<p>The reports of a huge gold find came from samples submitted by Bre-X's head of exploration John Felderhof and his team of geologists, including de Guzman.</p>
<p>De Guzman died on March 19 after falling mysteriously out of a helicopter flying him to the Busang jungles in Indonesia, where Bre-X had previously reported what appeared to be the largest gold find this century.</p>
<p>Indonesian police had said de Guzman might have committed suicide, based on a letter they said he left behind stating he was suffering from acute hepatitis-B.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything that is coming out in the newspapers, television, are all negative about my brother,&quot; Simplicio de Guzman said.</p>
<p>&quot;I just wish that they'll be more kind because my brother is no longer here to defend himself. I just wish he's the one talking right now because he can very well defend himself.</p>
<p>&quot;But he is not here. Somebody has taken away his life,&quot; Simplicio said.</p>
<p>The family has refuted reports de Guzman committed suicide, saying he had laid out too many plans for his Filipino family.</p>
<p>&quot;Definitely not,&quot; Simplicio said, when asked if Strathcona's report would affect their conviction that de Guzman did not kill himself.</p>
<p>Simplicio told Reuters that up to now the family had not received any official report from Indonesian police on the results of an autopsy performed on his brother.</p>
<p>&quot;I have been telling my brothers and sisters, this is getting so strange that we are not getting anything from anybody,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Simplicio said officials of the Philippine National Bureau of Investigation, which carried out a second autopsy on de Guzma, reported to the family that he died from a fall.</p>
