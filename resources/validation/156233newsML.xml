<p>Zaire on Thursday ruled out negotiation with its neighbours to avert war in the east of the crumbling state and accused Uganda of joining the fighting.</p>
<p>&quot;The government will not undertake any negotiation, will not participate in any regional conference while a part of national territory is occupied by foreign forces,&quot; Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo told an emergency session of parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;This war which the combined forces of Uganda, Burundi and Rwanda are waging against Zaire has brought to broad daylight Rwanda's intention not to welcome on its territory its nationals living in Zaire and to pursue its insane plan of annexing a part of our territory,&quot; Kengo said.</p>
<p>Kenya's state radio said Kenya planned to host a summit of seven African countries on November 5 but did not say if the main subject would be the war in eastern Zaire.</p>
<p>U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and French President Jacques Chirac have called for urgent talks to end the war that was initially between the Zaire army and ethnic Tutsis.</p>
<p>Rwanda has openly admitted sending its Tutsi-dominated army into Zaire and some independent sources also see the hand of Burundi's Tutsi army in the fighting.</p>
<p>Kengo's statement was the highest-level charge against Uganda, whose rulers and Rwanda's were once comrades in guerrilla struggles before they seized power in their neighbouring states.</p>
<p>Parliamentarians had accused Kengo and his ministers of taking a soft line on the fighting and a special session was summoned on Thursday for the government to justify its actions.</p>
<p>Defence Minister Admiral Mavua Mudima, also addressing parliament, said reports that part of the town of Goma had fallen into enemy hands were untrue.</p>
<p>Fighting raged near Goma on Thursday and aid agencies responsible for feeding more than a million Hutu refugees prepared to evacuate, aid officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have temporarily lost control of the Rusizi Plain in South Kivu and of Kibumba in North Kivu, but Goma is still in our hands,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Mavua said Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi aimed to take over a 1,000 km-long (600 miles) strip of Zairean territory and had prepared 15 battalions comprising 10,000 troops to accomplish the goal.</p>
<p>A Zaire military source said fighting had taken place near Goma airport, on the outskirts of the embattled town, but that the airport had not fallen.</p>
<p>&quot;A large number of Tutsis gathered at a church 200 to 300 metres from the airport and a considerable force of armed Tutsis came in from Rwanda to rescue them,&quot; the source said.</p>
<p>Incoming and outgoing mortar bombs and heavy weapons fire centered on an area about two km (one mile) north of Goma during the day, but by nightfall the firing was sporadic.</p>
<p>Reuters correspondent Buchizya Mseteka travelled with rebels inside Zaire and reported a swathe of territory from Lake Tanganyika to Lake Kivu was in rebel hands after a lightning campaign.</p>
<p>International attention has focused largely on the plight of the 1.1 million Hutu refugees in Zaire. Hutus massacred nearly one million Tutsis in Rwanda in 1994 and then fled en masse to Zaire.</p>
