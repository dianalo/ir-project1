<p>India's Sterlite Industries Ltd on Wednesday said it was ordered to shut operations at its southern copper smelter on July 6 by the Tamil Nadu state government investigating a gas leak incident.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been ordered to close down our smelting activities by the government authorities ... and we have promptly complied with the same,&quot; the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>The plant is located in the southern Tamil Nadu state. The company earlier this week denied newpaper reports of a gas leakage at the plant.</p>
<p>&quot;It is unfortunate that the responsibility for the accident, involving 100 workers in another factory (who were taken ill), has been placed squarely on the shoulders of our industry, without carrying out a thorough investigation,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Newspapers on Monday said Sterlite's smelter was asked to close down on the weekend following a gas leak.</p>
<p>&quot;There was no leakage of any kind from our plant and none of the people working at our unit has been affected,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Sterlite's 100,000 tonnes a year copper smelter started operations in December 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;We would like to add that nowhere in the world has any kind of environmental disaster been known to occur due to gaseous emissions from a copper smelter,&quot; the firm said.</p>
<p>&quot;The findings of (our) internal committee clearly show that our plant conditions were totally normal during the period of the accident next door,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The statement said that state authorities were conducting its own investigation into the leak and &quot;we are fully confident that their findings will endorse our point of view&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The SO2 (sulphur dioxide) monitoring devices in all our chimneys were fully operational and the recorded data clearly indicates that the emission levels were well within the stipulated norms,&quot; the company said.</p>
<p>The closure of the plant affected the firm's share prices.</p>
<p>Sterlite shares were quoted 5.75 rupees lower at 243 rupees on the Bombay Stock Exchange on Wednesday.</p>
