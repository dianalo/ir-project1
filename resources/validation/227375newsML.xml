<headline>Tietmeyer would not object to higher dollar - report.</headline>
<dateline>BONN, Germany</dateline>
<text>
<p>German central bank president Hans Tietmeyer was quoted as saying that the mark's value was about right against European currencies, but that he would not object to a higher dollar.</p>
<p>The mark had been overvalued because of the 1992 failure of the European currency grid system, he said, but the central bank was prevented from acting to weaken the currency because of its goal of price stability, he said.</p>
<p>Asked if the mark's value was about right now, he told the magazine Der Spiegel: &quot;In Europe it is, more or less. The dollar rate is also more appropriate than it was for some time, though I would have no objection to a slightly stronger dollar.&quot;</p>
<p>Tietmeyer was asked if the new European single currency would be more stable than the mark, whose fluctuations against the dollar have made life difficult for exporters.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe it will,&quot; he said. &quot;If the euro is a stable currency, that creates the chance that its foreign exchange value will fluctuate less than that of the mark. On the other hand, a soft euro would not be an advantage for the German economy.&quot;</p>
<p>The magazine was on newsstands on Saturday.</p>
