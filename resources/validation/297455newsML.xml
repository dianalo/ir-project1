<title>GERMANY: Germans on trial for kidnap of multi-millionaire.</title>
<headline>Germans on trial for kidnap of multi-millionaire.</headline>
<dateline>HAMBURG 1997-01-09</dateline>
<text>
<p>Two men went on trial on Thursday for the kidnapping of a Hamburg multimillionaire whose family paid the largest ransom in German criminal history to secure his release.</p>
<p>Wolfgang Koszics and Peter Richter face up to five and two years in jail respectively if convicted of involvement in the kidnapping last year of Jan Philipp Reemstma, the former owner of Germany's second largest tobacco firm.</p>
<p>Koszics, 55, confessed to the court that he had been part of the gang which kept Reemtsma locked in a cellar for five weeks until the ransom of 30 million marks ($19 million) was paid.</p>
<p>But he said he had not been involved in the actual abduction at Reemtsma's Hamburg home in March 1996.</p>
<p>The 43-year-old was blindfolded and taken to a cottage near Bremen, where he was kept chained up in a cellar.</p>
<p>Police imposed a news blackout at the time and communicated with the kidnappers through the personal columns of a Hamburg newspaper. They are still hunting for most of the ransom and the man they suspect of masterminding the crime, Thomas Drach.</p>
<p>Richter and Koszics, who face charges of criminal extortion, were arrested in Spain last May and extradited to Germany.</p>
<p>Richter did not speak on the first day of the trial but his lawyer told reporters he had only helped with lesser aspects of the crime, such as telephoning the Reemtsma family to arrange the handover of the ransom money.</p>
<p>Reemstma, who sold the family empire in 1980 and has since devoted much of his time and money to academic research and sponsorship of the arts, looked on without emotion as Koszics confessed to his part in the crime.</p>
