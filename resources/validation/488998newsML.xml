<headline>China oil firm says withdrawing disputed rig.</headline>
<dateline>BEIJING 1997-04-04</dateline>

<p>China's main offshore oil firm said on Friday it was withdrawing an oil exploration rig that sparked a diplomatic crisis with Vietnam when it started drilling in disputed waters between the communist neighbours.</p>
<p>&quot;The exploration work (of the oil rig Kan Tan III) has been completed, the plan is for it to leave during these two days,&quot; said an official of the China National Offshore Oil Corp.</p>
<p>He said it was not clear if the Kan Tan III had already left the area, where it had been drilling exploratory wells between China's tropical Hainan Island and Vietnam's central coast, but said the rig's withdrawal was assured.</p>
<p>&quot;Since the work is finished, why would it not leave?&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>Hanoi and Beijing have agreed to hold talks over the territorial dispute sparked by the activities of the Kan Tan III in a disputed area of the South China Sea about 64.5 nautical miles off the coast of central Vietnam.</p>
<p>Vietnamese naval officials said on Friday China had moved the rig away from the area, but gave few details.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes it's been moved,&quot; an officer at the headquarters for Vietnam's Naval Operations in the northern port town of Haiphong said without elaborating.</p>
<p>A Vietnamese spokesman said on Thursday that Hanoi and Beijing would hold expert-level talks in the Chinese capital on April 9 to resolve the dispute over sovereignty of the potentially resource-rich area.</p>
<p>China moved its Kan Tan III exploration rig into the area on March 7, a move that sparked verbal sparring between Hanoi and its huge northern neighbour.</p>
<p>China and Vietnam fought a brief but bloody border war in 1979 and clashed at sea in the 1980s, but Chinese officials have expressed confidence that negotiations would ease the communist neighbours' current differences.</p>
