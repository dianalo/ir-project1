<p>Philippine oil refiner Petron Corp on Thursday reported better-than-expected net income of 4.238 billion pesos in 1996 and analysts said it was poised for growth as a result of oil industry deregulation.</p>
<p>In 1995, Petron reported net profit of 4.020 billion pesos ($152.85 million) and a Reuter poll of eight brokerages this month had predicted the firm's 1996 profits at 3.97 billion pesos ($150.95 million).</p>
<p>The analysts said they made slightly lower projections because the company was expected to lose money after the government implemented an automatic oil price formula, an interim step to full deregulation.</p>
<p>&quot;Many downgraded their projections due to the automatic pricing scheme,&quot; ING Barings analyst Gio de la Rosa said.</p>
<p>Under the scheme implemented last August, the government permitted monthly adjustments to local oil prices.</p>
<p>The adjustments were based on Singapore Posted Prices and analysts said they did not reflect immediately the higher international prices which are pressuring local oil firms.</p>
<p>Petron, which is 40 percent owned by Saudi Arabia's Aramco, said losses from the pricing formula were offset by higher sales.</p>
<p>It said it grossed record sales revenue of 53.4 billion pesos in 1996, up from 44.641 billion in the previous year.</p>
<p>Analysts said full deregulation of the oil industry set to be implemented on February 7 would further boost prospects for Petron, which in 1996 had a 41.4 percent share of the market.</p>
<p>&quot;We might just expect higher margins brought about by the fact that Petron will now have pricing flexibility. Prior to full deregulation, oil companies could not just readily increase their netback,&quot; Raul Ruiz, research head at Sun Hung Kai Securities, said.</p>
<p>Under the regulated regime, oil refiners were allowed a return-on-rate base (RORB) of just eight percent.</p>
<p>There were controls on marketing and oil prices which were fixed by the government after conducting public hearings which often took months.</p>
<p>Oil firms could claim the difference between local and international prices from a government-run buffer fund. But with international prices far outstripping the local controlled prices, the fund ran into a deficit of some 2.5 billion pesos.</p>
<p>Petron and the country's two other oil refiners are yet to receive money from their claims and the government has said it will try to settle the payments by 1998.</p>
<p>Deregulation could be a double-edged sword as the benefits of the free market would have to be taken along with the prospect of new competitors entering the field, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;With full deregulation, Petron will no longer have to go through a lot of politics to get their (price) increases,&quot; Erwin Tan, research head at Abacus Securities Corp, said.</p>
<p>But competition was likely, he added.</p>
<p>At present, the only other refiners in the Philippines are Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corp, a unit of the Royal Dutch/Shell group ; and Caltex Philippines, a unit of Texaco Inc and Chevron Corp.</p>
<p>Helen Alvarez, research head at All Asia Securities, said Petron was prepared to face possible new entrants.</p>
<p>&quot;Petron is prepared for the rainy days ... the company has been improving capacity,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;For 1997, we can expect Petron to post profits growth of 15 to 20 percent,&quot; Alvarez added.</p>
