<p>The FBI's second highest official, who has been dealing with the controversy over its crime laboratory, will soon leave, triggering a series of senior management changes, FBI officials said Friday.</p>
<p>They said next month's planned departure of Deputy Director Weldon Kennedy was unrelated to the problems in the crime lab over possible contamination of evidence in the Oklahoma City bombing and various other high-profile cases.</p>
<p>They said the management moves had been agreed upon before the recent removal of four laboratory officials, including suspended whistleblower Frederic Whitehurst, whose complaints led to the investigation into the forensic unit.</p>
<p>Kennedy has been placed in charge of supervising the law enforcement agency's response to the lab problems because FBI Director Louis Freeh removed himself from the matter, the officials said.</p>
<p>The many cases cited by Whitehurst in complaining about scientific misconduct and prosecutorial bias include a Georgia mail bomb case prosecuted by Freeh before becoming FBI chief.</p>
<p>&quot;Weldon has been calling all the shots,&quot; one FBI official said of the crime laboratory, which came under criticism in an investigation by the Justice Department's inspector general.</p>
<p>They said Kennedy, who was named to the No. 2 post in August 1995, initially planned to stay for a year, but ended up remaining longer than expected and wanted to leave.</p>
<p>The officials said Freeh plans to move William Esposito, now head of the FBI's criminal division, to the No. 2 post.</p>
<p>Replacing Esposito would be Robert Bryant, now in charge of the FBI's National Security Division, which handles terrorism and espionage investigations.</p>
<p>The officials said the last change involved John Lewis, a longtime deputy to Bryant, becoming assistant director for national security.</p>
<p>The changes, expected to take place by the end of February, have been proposed by Freeh, but have yet to be approved by Attorney General Janet Reno, the officials said.</p>
<p>At the crime lab, the Justice Department's inspector general, with the help of a team of outside scientific experts, conducted an investigation for more than a year.</p>
<p>A recently completed draft report, which has yet to be released, sharply criticised the unit for poor management practices and sloppy handling of evidence, officials said.</p>
<p>Thomas Pickard, assistant director for the FBI's Washington field office, told reporters he wanted to wait for the final report, but added, &quot;A lot of things have been taken out of context.&quot;</p>
