<p>The United Nations has started to evacuate humanitarian staff from eastern Zaire, where government troops are battling Banyamulenge ethnic Tutsis, the head of the U.N. Development Programme (UNDP) in Rwanda said on Monday.</p>
<p>Omar Bakhet told Reuters the evacuation operation that began late on Sunday had already moved 20 humanitarian staff out of the war zone. Bakhet could not say if the operation, which was continuing, would involve non-U.N. staff.</p>
<p>Ethnic warfare involving the Banyamulenge, Tutsis who came to Zaire from Rwanda at the end of the 18th century, has intensified in and around the eastern Zairean town of Uvira, aid workers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The evacuation operation to take humanitarian staff out of Uvira has already started. It started last night. So far around 20 humanitarian staff have been evacuated,&quot; said Bakhet.</p>
<p>He added: &quot;The operation is continuing.&quot;</p>
<p>Aid workers said Banyamulenge Tutsi rebels had cut a section of the highway between the eastern Zaire provincial towns of Bukavu and Uvira.</p>
<p>Bakhet said the world body was also evacuating staff from the city of Goma, unaffected by the fighting, but he could not give reasons.</p>
<p>&quot;We have also evacuated some staff from Goma into Gisenyi (Rwandan town),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Aid sources said late on Sunday heavy fighting was continuing in and around Uvira, adding that between 4,000 and 5,000 Zaireans had moved into the town from the south. Fighting was said to be going on in the town itself and in the region to the south.</p>
<p>Humanitarian workers in Uvira itself said many people had been killed and wounded in renewed fighting between the Zairean military and Banyamulenge rebels north of the town.</p>
<p>Aid workers also reported a flood of refugees from the area north of Zaire's eastern provincial capital Goma towards the village of Rutchrio, to the north, following armed attacks.</p>
<p>With the conflict looking likely to draw in the armies of neighbouring Rwanda and Burundi, both dominated by Tutsis, the U.N. dispatched envoy Ibrahim Fall to try and defuse tension.</p>
<p>Military sources said on Saturday Zairean soldiers were being resupplied with heavy weapons to respond to attacks by ethnic Tutsis, whom Zaire says have been sent by neighbouring Rwanda via Burundi to destablise its eastern region.</p>
<p>The flight of Banyamulenge from their homes in Zaire has created a new crisis in an area where 1.1 million Rwandan Hutu refugees are sheltered. The Hutu refugees fled, fearing retribution, after the 1994 genocide in Rwanda in which Hutus massacred an estimated one million Tutsis and moderate Hutus.</p>
