<p>A fund sell-off in New York on Friday has left gold charts slightly bruised, and support at $346 could be severely tested again this week, analysts said.</p>
<p>Major trade houses and funds slashed the bullion price to $345.70 an ounce from London's $346.95/$347.45 close after it held comfortably above $347-$348 all week. New York bullion ended at $346.60/$347.10.</p>
<p>The drop, triggered by worse-than-expected U.S. inflation and retail sales data, may have paved the way for further losses to tempt physical offtake in gold. But dealers see good support around $346.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a pretty firm floor at the $346 level,&quot; said Rob Weinberg, gold securities analyst at Deutche Morgan Grenfel (DMG).</p>
<p>&quot;It didn't want to stay there (below $346.00) for very long. I think we've seen the lows for now,&quot; said one London dealer.</p>
<p>But if $346 broke, more crucial support would come in at $340.</p>
<p>In Friday's data, the U.S. March Producer Price Index fell 0.1 percent but the core rate, excluding food and energy rose a higher-than-expected 0.4 percent, while March retail sales rose 0.2 percent.</p>
<p>These fuelled speculation of a U.S. rate hike at the next Federal Open Marlet Committee (FOMC) meeting in May, prompting a sharp fall in Wall Street stocks on Friday.</p>
<p>Higher interest rates are viewed as lessening the attraction of gold.</p>
<p>Gold's prospects were also obscured by the rise in the U.S. dollar to a new five-year high against the yen and a new three-year high against the mark last week.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe gold, and to a lesser degree precious metals in general, are fighting an uphill battle against currencies and other financial instruments as wealth safe havens and will maintain a general downward price bias until there is some sign of global inflation, Bear Stearns senior analyst Bill Byers said.</p>
<p>This week gold dealers will focus on the U.S. March industrial production data due out on Wednesday for further clues on interest rates. In addition, U.S. consumers prices (CPI) will be released on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The chart outlook was muddled after a triangle formation following a rally in March, but in the longer term DMG's Weinberg said the upside potential was perceived to be substantially greater than the downside risk.</p>
<p>Palladium also lost steam in the selling flurry, although its fortunes were quite different as dealers juggled positions against a new twist in the issue of Russian exports to leading importer Japan.</p>
<p>&quot;At the moment one would say that it's a bit of a sea-saw between the longs and the shorts,&quot; commented Weinberg. &quot;People are just waiting to see what the next bit of news is,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Prices fell from $160.00 last week after a Russian finance ministry official said a decree on PGM exports would be signed this week, allowing shipments to resume in May after a four-month delay. Russia is the world's biggest palladium supplier.</p>
<p>Prices then rebounded to test resistance at $160.00, but again dropped back to $154.00.</p>
<p>Dealers said wide fluctations were likely to continue until there was final proof that sales from Russia would start. A decree for export quotas is still awaiting the prime minister's signature after a chain of administrative snags.</p>
<p>Andy Smith, precious metals analyst at United Bank of Switzerland (UBS), reckoned the Russians would want to get the matter sorted out before the Platinum Week in London beginning on May 19.</p>
<p>&quot;They could come with an explanation or not come at all,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But techncially there was no limitation to a backwardation. &quot;It will last as long as it lasts then it will go away (when material becomes available),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Technical analysts expect a move to $130-$140 once the sales resume.</p>
<p>Hedge funds have been buying palladium on expected shortages while many Japanese trade houses sold the metal short thinking the Russians would try to catch up with their export programme once sales resumed</p>
<p>Previously, palladium prices were capped at $130-$140 with producer selling emerging to discourage substitution by other metals.</p>
<p>Analysts also loked for platinum prices to hold steady on the back of strong chart signals and expected physical demand, although a resumption of Russian sales would apply pressure in the medium term.</p>
<p>&quot;Platinum is a metal seeking to burst,&quot; said Weinberg.</p>
<p>Silver dropped on Friday but was seen supported at $4.72/$4.74.</p>
