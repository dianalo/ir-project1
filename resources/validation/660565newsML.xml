<title>USA: Two indicted in murder of Time Warner chief's son.</title>
<headline>Two indicted in murder of Time Warner chief's son.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-06-12</dateline>
<text>
<p>Two young New Yorkers were indicted on Thursday in the torture and killing of Jonathan Levin, the son of Time Warner Inc.'s top executive.</p>
<p>Corey Arthur, a 19-year-old paroled crack dealer and a former student of Levin's at a city high school, was indicted on charges of first- and second-degree murder and robbery.</p>
<p>His alleged accomplice, Montoun Hart, 25, was indicted on charges of second-degree murder and robbery.</p>
<p>Levin, 31, was the son of Gerald Levin, chief executive and chairman of the media conglomerate Time Warner. He was found on June 2 in his one-bedroom Manhattan apartment, stabbed and shot once in the head. He had been bound and gagged, and there was no sign of forced entry.</p>
<p>Levin was a popular teacher at New York's Taft High School who befriended struggling students. Lawyers for Arthur, however, said they were investigating an unspecified &quot;substantial&quot; relationship between Levin and their client.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a relationship between Mr. Levin and Corey Arthur and that relationship is going to play a part in this case,&quot; Tony Ricco, Arthur's lead attorney, told reporters outside Manhattan's Supreme Court building.</p>
<p>Hart, who has a number of convictions for such crimes as petty larceny, faces up to life in prison if convicted. Arthur could face the death penalty or life without parole.</p>
<p>The two were expected to enter pleas when they are formally arraigned. Hart's arraignment is scheduled for June 26 and Arthur's for July 7.</p>
<p>Police allege Levin was murdered for his automatic bank teller card.</p>
