<p>A hundred and thirty years after Chinese immigrants first sailed to New Zealand to mine for gold, the country finally has its first Asian-born member of parliament.</p>
<p>Chinese-born Pansy Wong is walking an untrodden path -- providing a strong voice for a once silent community.</p>
<p>&quot;My election has led them to a very heightened interest in the whole political debate, which is fantastic,&quot; she said of the country's 185,000-strong Asian community.</p>
<p>&quot;They see electing one of their own candidates as a symbol that Asians are part of New Zealand. A symbol that in New Zealand everything is possible if you put your work into it. It really doesn't matter where you come from.&quot;</p>
<p>Wong, 41, won a seat for the conservative National Party in a general election last month which produced a hung parliament. National remains as caretaker government while coalition talks drag on.</p>
<p>Her background, with its elements of struggle and tenacity, echoes the stories of many immigrants.</p>
<p>Born in Shanghai, Wong and her family escaped the oppression of Maoist China for Hong Kong, before making a further move in 1974 for a better life in New Zealand.</p>
<p>&quot;The family joke was my father 'discovered' New Zealand,&quot; Wong told Reuters in her small office in a parliamentary annex brimming with the influx of new MPs.</p>
<p>He was working in the Chinese shipping industry and New Zealand was one of the countries he visited.</p>
<p>&quot;He...believes it is a good place for family, for future. We don't practice democratic voting in the family and when Dad decided, that's it,&quot; she laughed with her characteristic humour.</p>
<p>With a Chinese name meaning 'fragrant flower', 19-year-old Pansy trained as an accountant at a New Zealand university where she met her future husband, Malaysian-born Sammy Wong.</p>
<p>After years working in a raft of business and community positions, and helping new migrants settle in the country, Wong was approached by political parties to run in New Zealand's first election under proportional representation.</p>
<p>She chose the National Party, saying she believed in its philosophy of private enterprise and individual rights.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe the timing is right for Asian New Zealanders to stand up and participate,&quot; Wong declared.</p>
<p>&quot;I feel very strongly that in New Zealand, we have only 3.6 million people and every human resource is valuable.&quot;</p>
<p>In New Zealand there has been an uneasy history between migrants and their new home. Until the early 1950s, Chinese immigrants were denied citizenship and the right to vote.</p>
<p>Race and immigration again erupted into the nation's consciousness this year when nationalistic New Zealand First leader Winston Peters accused some immigrants of &quot;abusing New Zealand's hospitality&quot; and promised to cut immigration &quot;to the bone&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;It's the migrants who are already here who feel once again they seem to be targeted by the statements he used,&quot; said Wong.</p>
<p>Peters's comments and Australia's vigorous racism debate have provoked much reaction in Asia, but Wong challenges whether they are harmful for New Zealand's trade and relations in the region.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it is sensational but let's not understate the intelligence of people in Asia. They understand New Zealand is a democratic country. A democratic country means you can't censor the freedom of speech so they...look beyond at what are the actions of the government, what are the actual policies.&quot;</p>
<p>Wong has extensive business contacts in Asia and hopes to use these to expand and enhance New Zealand's dealings there.</p>
<p>&quot;Due to my election this time, the interest and excitement in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore has been tremendous. I can utilise that opportunity...for the benefit of New Zealand in terms of business and in terms of understanding.</p>
<p>&quot;The only problem I have is time, I think,&quot; she smiled.</p>
