<p>The skyline of Bruges, self-styled Venice of the north, is taking shape on the Belgian coast. Except this time the mediaeval towers and minarets are made entirely out of sand and water.</p>
<p>More than 50 sand sculptors -- mostly volunteers -- from Denmark, Ireland, the United States, Belgium and the Netherlands, have been labouring for 10 days to convert some 10,000 tonnes of sand into Europe's biggest sandcastle.</p>
<p>The structure, standing nearly 13 metres (42 feet) high and standing 51 metres (163 feet) wide and 38 metres (122 feet) deep, is a monument to disposable art.</p>
<p>&quot;By the time we have finished on Friday we will have taken 10 man years just to sculpt it, and in a month it will have worn away,&quot; Dutch project leader Eppo Vogel told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;But it is worth it. The enjoyment of creating. The challenge. The enjoyment it gives people. And then there is the memory. That will always be there,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>But it is not just any old sand. It is a specially blended cocktail of different river sands imported from the Netherlands which, when soaked and then compressed, take on a consistency not unlike cement -- although far less durable.</p>
<p>&quot;It is disposable art, but I don't mind,&quot; said sculptor Jan Selen, a student from the Dutch pottery town of Delft.</p>
<p>&quot;It is really enjoyable doing it. You can make really beautiful things. It is really cool,&quot; he enthused.</p>
<p>The structure has to be far more durable than the childhood sandcastles on the beach.</p>
<p>When it opens to the paying public on Friday, coincidentally the Assumption Day holiday, it will have to last a month open to the elements and survive the attention of the 100,000 people expected to come to gape in admiration at the detailed carvings.</p>
<p>Towering above them will be the Bruges skyline, and carved into the slopes around them will be depictions of the 1302 Battle of the Golden Spurs -- the last time the Flemish beat the French at war.</p>
<p>Sand sculpting was invented by American Gerry Kirk of California and moved to the Netherlands about six years ago when a group of enthusiasts set up the European Sand Sculpting Association.</p>
<p>The art form is steadily spreading across Europe and now provides full-time employment all the year round for a handful of experts such as Vogel, and part time enjoyment for many more volunteers.</p>
<p>The sculptures are mainly indoors and for tourism events and fairs. Until the Zeebruges project, the only beach work had been at the Dutch resort of Scheveningen, near The Hague.</p>
<p>The projects are not cheap. The Bruges tourist office is paying 9.7 million francs ($255,000) for its sandcastle.</p>
<p>But for Vogel the next project already beckons. He is off to San Diego after Zeebruges at take part in a project to build a sand sculpture 22 metres (70 feet) high.</p>
