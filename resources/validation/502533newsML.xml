<p>Australia, strapped for cash but feeling its strategic superiority in Southeast Asia slipping away, on Friday announced a sweeping attack on defence bureaucracy aimed at boosting its frontline operations.</p>
<p>&quot;We're going to shift expenditure from the bureaucracy of defence into the front line of defence,&quot; Prime Minister John Howard said.</p>
<p>&quot;There'll be more money to spend on equipment and on the sharp end, the front end,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Defence Minister Ian McLachlan said 8,000 support jobs would go, with many uniformed staff redeployed to combat positions.</p>
<p>The reforms should ultimately shift up to A$1 billion (US$780 million) of the A$10 billion-a-year defence budget away from administration and into weapons and training, he said.</p>
<p>McLachlan said Australia's inefficient defence bureaucracy had to be squeezed in order to bolster falling defence spending in a post Cold War world where regional instability had risen.</p>
<p>&quot;Post-Cold War, things are less certain than they were,&quot; he said, noting that defence spending had fallen from 2.6 percent of gross domestic product 10 years ago to 1.8 percent now.</p>
<p>Author of the defence review, Malcolm McIntosh, a former British defence procurement chief, said Australia needed to strengthen its defence frontline as economically booming Asian nations boosted their military strength.</p>
<p>&quot;Not that long ago, we were a mini-superpower in our own region,&quot; McIntosh told reporters. &quot;Our economy was substantially larger and the amount we bought for our defence dollar was substantially larger than anyone else around our region.</p>
<p>&quot;That's changing and changing very quickly... The economies around the region are growing rapidly and all of those countries are now in a position to acquire the sort of things that only we could afford a few years ago,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Although Australia's armed forces are still the most powerful south of China and east of India, its neighbours now operate the advanced equipment it once monopolised.</p>
<p>From World War Two until the 1980s Australia was alone in the region with its leading-edge fighter aircraft.</p>
<p>Even now, its 70-odd F/A-18 Hornets are an up-to-date fighter force, but Malaysia also operates Hornets and Indonesia has a handful of the similarly modern F-16.</p>
<p>McLachlan said Australia had no regional enemies but felt it had to respond to other countries' capabilities rather than their intentions, which could change quickly.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to be ready for whatever happens, he said, citing last month's unexpected instability in Papua New Guinea, in which soldiers took to the streets calling for the removal of government leaders.</p>
<p>&quot;It may have been that we would have had to look at the possibility of getting some people out of Papua New Guinea in recent times,&quot; he said. &quot;It just came out of the blue.&quot;</p>
<p>McLachlan said he needed money for airborne-early-warning radar aircraft, better weapons and sensors on warships, more helicopter and ground transport for the army, and modernisation of the Hornet fighters and F-111 strike bombers.</p>
<p>The government has previously said priorities include two more Collins Class submarines and stand-off missiles for F-111s.</p>
<p>The Labor opposition demanded action on new equipment.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no excuse (now) for the minister to continue stalling on the purchase of the two additional Collins submarines and airborne-early-warning planes,&quot; opposition spokesman Arch Bevis said in a statement.</p>
