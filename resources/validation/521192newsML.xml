<headline>Tribune Q1 publishing profit rises.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-04-18</dateline>

<p>Tribune Co said Friday that operating profit from its publishing business rose 51 percent in the first quarter to $95 million, due mainly to higher advertising revenues and lower newsprint prices.</p>
<p>In the 1996 first quarter its publishing operating profit was $63 million.</p>
<p>&quot;Our publishing group had an exceptionally strong first quarter with better-than-expected revenue growth coupled with lower newsprint prices,&quot; John Madigan, Tribune chairman, said in a statement.  </p>
<p>First quarter publishing revenues increased eight percent from a year ago, to $355 million. Advertising revenues rose 10 percent due to higher rates and linage, with retail advertising up six percent, general up eight percent and classified up 13 percent.</p>
<p>Newsprint and ink expenses dropped 28 percent in the quarter. Average newsprint prices were down about 30 percent from 1996, while consumption rose five percent.</p>
<p>Other publishing expenses were up seven percent, mainly due to higher compensation costs and increased development of Internet businesses, Tribune said.  </p>
<p>Tribune said its first quarter operating profit from broadcasting and entertainment was up two percent to a record $30 million, from $29 million a year ago. Television operating profits rose 23 percent to a record $31 million and were up 21 percent excluding acquisitions.</p>
<p>This was partially offset, however, by an equity loss of $11 million in the WB Network, compared with a loss of $3 million in 1996. Tribune increased its stake in the network to 21.9 percent from 12.5 percent in the 1997 first quarter.</p>
<p>First quarter operating revenues for braodcasting and entertainment rose eight percent, to $201 million from $187 million a year ago, due mainly to a nine percent increase from television, Tribune said.</p>
<p>Television gains were attributed primarily to improvement in Chicago and the acquisition of six television stations from Renaissance Communications last month and of KSWB-San Diego in April 1996. Excluding acquisitions, television revenues rose five percent.</p>
<p>Tribune is a media company with operations in television, radio and publishing, including the Chicago Tribune newspaper.</p>
