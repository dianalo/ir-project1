<p>In the glory days of the old Philadelphia Flyers in the mid 1970s, two consecutive seasons ended in Stanley Cup championships and the customary laps around the rink, Cup held high in turn by every player.</p>
<p>Having joined the league in its first expansion in 1967, the Flyers' organisation was only a few years old in those championship seasons, 1973-74 and 1974-75. Some of the names to have held that Cup overhead, now carved upon it, have faded into the chasm of time.</p>
<p>Don Saleski, anyone? Orest Kindrachuck, Bob &quot;The Hound&quot; Kelly, Ross Lonsberry?</p>
<p>Does the name Simone Nolet ring a bell for the Flyers' assistant captain Rod Brind'Amour? It should. Number 17 was their common bond.</p>
<p>In taking the 1997 National Hockey League's Eastern Conference championship four games to one with a dominating 4-2 victory over the New York Rangers Sunday, the Flyer superstars -- team captain Eric Lindros, 50-goal scorer John LeClair and future Hall of Famer Paul Coffey -- certainly made their presence felt.</p>
<p>But the Flyers enter the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time since 1987 led as much by the team's footsoldiers, the muckers and grinders, as by the marquee names.</p>
<p>&quot;That's why we're here. They're why we're going to the finals,&quot; Lindros said, barely hestitating at the question.</p>
<p>&quot;My play or Johnnie's (LeClair's) play...It's not because of Paul Coffey's play or (Flyers defenceman and assistant captain) Eric Dejardins' play. We've got a number of different guys who have stepped up and played tremendous games for us,&quot; Lindros said after the game.</p>
<p>Certainly much of Philadelphia's success lay with the team's stars, Lindros especially. In scoring his 11th goal of the playoffs, at 5:18 of the first period in Sunday's Game 5, Lindros picked up where he had left off -- celebrating after his goal with only 6.8 seconds left to win Game 4.</p>
<p>At key times in every game, Lindros's leadership -- along with his enormous size and power -- was painfully evident. For some New York players, very painfully.</p>
<p>But the crushing body checks from Trent Klatt, the goals by a John Druce or a Shjon Podein and two goals in the first five minutes of Game 1 from the team's young rookies deserved Oscars for supporting roles.</p>
<p>Brind'Amour, trade bait for much of the first half of this season, had two goals in Game 5 on Sunday, bringing his playoff goal total to 10 -- just one fewer than Lindros.</p>
<p>&quot;Eric played great,&quot; Brind'Amour said, &quot;but we had other guys (contributing), and I think that's been our key all year.&quot;</p>
<p>Lindros's version: &quot;Roddy (Brind'Amour) -- he's on fire. He's played so well for us game in and game out. He's such a battler.&quot;</p>
<p>On this day 22 years ago, the Flyers beat the Buffalo Sabres 5-1 to go up three games to two in the Stanley Cup finals.</p>
<p>Two Flyer goals on that day came from Dave &quot;The Hammer&quot; Schultz. His name springs to memory, but not for his goal scoring. Schultz was the team thug, and played most games with his gloves off and his fists in an opponent's face.</p>
<p>Two days later Philadelphia would take its second -- and latest -- NHL title.</p>
<p>When these Flyers begin the Stanley Cup Finals against either the Detroit Red Wings or the Colorado Avalanche, they will surely have a &quot;Hammer&quot; in their toolbelt.</p>
<p>But years later, his name may be forgotten.</p>
