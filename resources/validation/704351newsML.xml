<title>UK: Four ex-UK Conservative MPs criticised on sleaze.</title>
<headline>Four ex-UK Conservative MPs criticised on sleaze.</headline>

<p>A British parliamentary report attacked two former Conservative ministers on Thursday for conduct &quot;well below the standards expected of members of parliament&quot; in accepting cash from a businessman for lobbying on his behalf.</p>
<p>The report by parliament's standards commissioner Sir Gordon Downey said Tim Smith received at least 18,000 pounds ($30,150) from Mohammed Al-Fayed and Neil Hamilton got an amount which was unknown but was probably at least as great.</p>
<p>The long-awaited report also criticised two other former Conservative legislators for receiving money from parliamentary lobbyist Ian Greer and failing to register the payments in the register of MPs' interests. But it said allegations against six other former MPs could not be substantiated.</p>
<p>The report now goes to parliament's Standards and Privileges Committee. But because none of the MPs criticised retained their seats at the May 1 election, it will have severely limited powers to punish them.</p>
<p>Allegations of sleaze cast a shadow over the Conservatives in the run-up to election. Cash-for-questions charges against Hamilton in particular created an impression of a party grown too used to the trappings of power after 18 years in office.</p>
<p>The Labour Party even claimed that Prime Minister John Major called the election early to prevent Downey's report from being published before the voters gave their verdict.</p>
<p>Hamilton lost his seat in a Labour landslide to former BBC war correspondent Martin Bell, standing as an independent on an anti-corruption platform.</p>
<p>Bell's candidacy led to a memorable election scene when he was unexpectedly confronted by Hamilton and his fiercely loyal wife Christine and challenged to say whether he was trying to ruin the former minister's political career.</p>
<p>Downey's report said that, in addition to receiving cash from Fayed, Hamilton was entertained at the businessman's luxury Ritz Hotel in Paris.</p>
<p>&quot;The hospitality Mr Hamilton received from Mr Al Fayed...was intended, and accepted, as part of his reward for lobbying. It was not, as it should have been, registered,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>Downey also said Hamilton &quot;deliberately misled&quot; the then Trade and Industry Secretary Michael Heseltine when he questioned him about the allegations against him.</p>
<p>Hamilton said he was &quot;extremely disappointed and devastated&quot; by Downey's conclusions. &quot;I am perplexed more than anything else. How can he have reached this conclusion?,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Hamilton has always strenuously denied accepting envelopes stuffed with cash from Fayed in return for asking questions in parliament on behalf of the Egyptian-born businessman.</p>
<p>But he had previously admitted to breaking House of Commons rules by inadvertently failing to declare hospitality at the Paris Ritz.</p>
<p>Smith, by contrast, resigned from his ministerial post when the allegations surfaced. He was then disowned by his constituency party and did not contest the election.</p>
<p>The report also criticised former members Sir Andrew Bowden and Sir Michael Grylls. It said Bowden failed to declare an election donation from parliamentary lobbyist Ian Greer and Grylls deliberately misled a parliamentary committee about payments by Greer.</p>
