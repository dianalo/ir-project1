<p>Singapore fuel oil swaps were steady despite a large build in stocks as the market brushed aside the news of the higher than expected inventory level in the island, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The was no change to the markets after the stock data were released,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>March fuel oil swaps were quoted unchanged from Wednesday at $98.50/$99.50 per tonne with April seen at $97.00/$98.00, brokers said.  </p>
<p>Earlier the Trade Development Board data showed a 2.097 million barrel build in residual fuel stocks to 12.692 million barrels for the week ended March 12.</p>
<p>The stocks were at a 10-month high.</p>
<p>Traders said the market was looking to the physical market for direction.</p>
<p>&quot;If there are aggressive offers in the cash market this evening than for sure the swaps will fall,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>The gas oil swaps were up slightly late afternoon after an early day rally on sustained physical support from a local trader.  </p>
<p>The backwardation further out months of April and May have widened after a local trader extended his recent purchases of the prompt cargoes to include April barrels.</p>
<p>As a result, the April/May time spread is also widening and was last quoted at $1.10/$1.20, a far cry from the 30-50 cents seen last week. The March/April is also at well above the $1.00 per barrel mark.</p>
<p>April gas oil rose to $25.25/$25.40 per barrel from Wednesday's $24.80/$24.90, brokers said.</p>
<p>The strength came from purchases by a local trader who had since the start of last week bought around 2.2 million barrels.  </p>
<p>On Wednesday the trader bought three cargoes totalling 520,000-barrels at between $28.00-26.45 per barrel, fob Singapore.</p>
<p>The prices again reflecting the steeply backwardated market.</p>
<p>The jet fuel fell despite the support from the same local trader who had bought about one million barrels since the start of last week, as market factored in declining seasonal demand, traders said.</p>
<p>The April jet fuel/gas oil spread collapsed to trade earlier in the day at 35 cents per barrel down from an early week high of about $1.00, brokers said.  </p>
