<title>UK: VENABLES PAYS SUGAR IN SOCCER LIBEL CASE.</title>
<headline>VENABLES PAYS SUGAR IN SOCCER LIBEL CASE.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-17</dateline>
<text>
<p>Former England soccer coach Terry Venables agreed to pay his former friend and club chairman Alan Sugar damages of 100,001 pounds ($158,500) on Thursday to settle a case prompted by allegations in his autobiography.</p>
<p>The feud between the two men, who joined forces in June 1991 to revive London club Tottenham Hotspur, helped persuade Venables to resign from the England job after the European soccer championships earlier this year to concentrate on a number of court cases.</p>
<p>In Venables' autobiography, the former Barcelona manager and Tottenham chief executive made a series of allegations about Sugar's financial dealings at Tottenham following the pair's purchase of the club.</p>
<p>&quot;As he (Sugar) maintained immediately, and does to this day, the allegations which had been made by Mr Venables were completely untrue,&quot; Sugar's lawyer, Timothy Cassel, told London's High Court.</p>
<p>Sugar, who will also receive his costs up to March this year, will donate the damages to charity. Sugar, the founder of the Amstrad computer firm, remains chairman of premier league Tottenham.</p>
<p>The case was due to come to trial this month and the award &quot;may be regarded as being at or near the top end of the scale of damages which ... Mr Sugar could have expected to recover if successful in the trial,&quot; Cassel said.</p>
<p>Venables and the book's publishers have undertaken to cease publication of the autobiography forthwith, to destroy all unsold copies of the book and not to publish the passages complained of in any other book.</p>
<p>Venables is also fighting a move by the Department of Trade and Industry to disqualify him from being a company director. This action relates to Venables' time at Tottenham in the early 1990s. ($1=.6309 Pound)</p>
