<p>Philippe Bruggisser, president and chief executive of the SAirGroup, said he expects the Swissair airline to be profitable by the end of this year.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect Swissair to be in the black at the end of the current year,&quot; Bruggisser said in an interview with the Swiss financial bi-weekly Finanz und Wirtschaft.</p>
<p>Bruggisser also wants to cut Swissair's costs per seat kilometre to seven Swiss cents from a previous target of nine cents.</p>
<p>The current production costs per kilometre is between 11.4 and nine, a Swissair spokesman said, confirming Bruggiser's statements to the Finanz und Wirtschaft.</p>
<p>&quot;One year ago I clearly said that nine cents is an interim goal. In two to three years we have to get down to seven cents,&quot; Bruggisser said, adding:</p>
<p>&quot;We have to learn to live with the fact that yields in the airline business will continue to fall.&quot;</p>
<p>Bruggisser also said that he was convinced that air fares worldwide still had not bottomed out and all airlines had to adjust to this.</p>
<p>On Tuesday Swissair announced that Bruggisser would hand over operational responsibility for the Swissair airline to American Jeffrey Katz in January 1998. Currently, Bruggisser is both in charge of the SAirGroup and Swissair.</p>
<p>&quot;Heading the entire group and Swissair could be justified for a certain period. But the double burden is not ideal over a longer period of time,&quot; Bruggisser said.</p>
<p>He acknowledged that handing over responsibility to foreign executives would weaken the Swiss culture within Swissair, but an international company with 60 percent of its customers from abroad must adapt its structures.</p>
<p>&quot;I want a stronger mixture of management with foreigners,&quot; Bruggisser told the Finanz und Wirtschaft.</p>
<p>Swissair is the scheduled airline of the SAirGroup, a holding company that oversees the group's various activities, such as airlines, hotels, catering and cargo.</p>
<p>In the future the results of the Swissair airline will closely reflect the result of flight operations.</p>
<p>Swissair has never published results of its flight operations, but Bruggisser's target is that flight operations should break even by 1997.</p>
<p>In February Swissair said the results of flight operations deteriorated in 1996 due to the continued erosion of fares and the significant rise in fuel costs.</p>
<p>Industry analysts widely believe flight operations operate with an annual loss of some 200 million francs. The company has never denied a loss of this magnitude.</p>
<p>Swissair's will report 1996 financial results on April 4.</p>
<p>In 1995 the Swissair group posted a net loss of 147 million francs ($110 million), but largely due to restructuring charges of 365 million that hid an improvement in its operating results.</p>
<p>In the the first six months of 1996 the loss narrowed to 51 million francs from 86 million.</p>
<p>The creation of SAirGroup was announced last year and will be submitted to shareholders for approval in May.</p>
