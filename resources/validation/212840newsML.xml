<p>Chechen rebel leaders who signed a weekend peace deal with Moscow after President Boris Yeltsin ordered a full troop withdrawal from the separatist region, cautiously claimed victory on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;We did not aim at gaining a military victory over the Russian army, which is big and has nuclear missiles,&quot; said the head of the Chechen rebel government, Aslan Maskhadov.</p>
<p>&quot;We fought to have no Russian soldier on our territory so that our citizens were not killed and I think we have achieved this,&quot; he told a news conference at a Moscow hotel.</p>
<p>The secluded hotel in the centre of Moscow was guarded by heavily-armed police. In the conference room there were Chechen fighters with pistols slung on their hips.</p>
<p>Maskhadov was effectively the top military commander of Chechen fighters who successfully fought Russian forces for 21 months from December 1994, when Yeltsin sent troops to break the North Caucasus region's independence drive.</p>
<p>The silver-haired Maskhadov, widely respected in Chechnya, said up to 100,000 civilians were killed in the bloody conflict, while his forces lost some 4,000 fighters. That total figure is well above the tens of thousands cited by independent experts.</p>
<p>Maskhadov and other leaders of the rebel government now effectively recognised by Moscow, appeared extremely cautious in their comments &quot;not to disrupt the situation&quot;.</p>
<p>But pride and emotion sometime broke out.</p>
<p>&quot;When we were called bandits, I think it was insulting for the Russian army,&quot; said Movladi Udugov, deputy to Maskhadov and the main Chechen spokesman. &quot;What type of army is it if it fights bandits for two years and cannot win?&quot;</p>
<p>Udugov praised the now sacked Russian security chief Alexander Lebed, saying he had played the role of &quot;a ram&quot; by forcing Moscow into signing a peace accord in August.</p>
<p>The separatists have good reason to be satisfied.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, in a major concession, ordered all remaining Russian troops to leave the region -- meeting the main outstanding demand of the rebels, apart from their paramount desire to secede from Russia altogether.</p>
<p>His order cleared way for a cooperation agreement signed later by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Maskhadov.</p>
<p>The weekend events reflected a new Russian strategy.</p>
<p>Having failed militarily, Moscow is now keen to secure its interests in Chechnya through economic ties.</p>
<p>&quot;There are people in Russia who have understood ambitions are nothing while real interests are everything,&quot; Udugov said.</p>
<p>Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, however, condemned the deal on Sunday, saying it spelled the break-up of the nation and demanding a vote of no-confidence in the government.</p>
<p>He told Interfax news agency it was &quot;unconstitutional and de jure marks the beinning of the break-up of Russia&quot;.</p>
<p>He added that the Constitutional Court and parliament should review the agreement, which he said &quot;smells of a Belovezh Mark 2&quot;, referring to the treaty signed by Yeltsin and other leaders in December 1991 which formally broke up the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The new agreement, valid until elections in the region on January 27, said the two sides had agreed to restore trade in goods and services by December 1 and work out customs regulations. Air, rail and road traffic are also to be restored.</p>
<p>Another accord on &quot;special economic relations&quot; between Moscow and Chechnya was to be worked out after the poll.</p>
<p>More importantly, the two sides vowed to sign a special deal on the transport and refining of oil on Chechen territory. The rebel government promised to safeguard refineries and pipelines.</p>
<p>Diverted oil was a major source of income for Chechnya in the three years of self-declared independence before Moscow's 1994 assault. Although no longer a significant oil producer, the region occupies a strategic position between the rest of Russia and the oil-rich Caspian state of Azerbaijan.</p>
