<p>The man who will take over as top prosecutor of Michigan's Oakland County said Wednesday it was unlikely he would pursue common-law charges against assisted-suicide activist Dr. Jack Kevorkian.</p>
<p>David Gorcyca, calling the assisted-suicide controversy a &quot;front-burner&quot; issue for him, told Reuters he believed state lawmakers should deliberate and give the public a clear lead. &quot;I'm looking for the legislature in Lansing to address that issue once and for all,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Gorcyca added that he needed to review the common-law criminal charges of assisting in a suicide brought against Kevorkian last week before deciding whether to continue to press them when he took office in January.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not sure what steps I will take. I want to review each of the cases and look at the facts and the circumstances and take whatever necessary and appropriate actions I see fit,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Gorcyca, a city commissioner for Detroit suburb Royal Oak and one-time assistant prosecutor, was originally believed to have lost Tuesday's race to succeed Richard Thompson as Oakland County's chief prosecutor. But a tabulation error was discovered Wednesday morning, and Gorcyca was named the winner over Democrat Steve Kaplan by a count of 239,423 to 232,193.</p>
<p>Kevorkian has proved an elusive quarry for prosecutors. The fiery 68-year-old retired pathologist has been acquitted of criminal charges in three trials involving five deaths. Two of the trials occurred this year under Thompson, a conservative law-and-order prosecutor who has become a bitter enemy of Kevorkian and his lawyer, Geoffrey Fieger.</p>
<p>Thompson lost his bid for another term when Gorcyca beat him out in a primary election in September. Last week, Thompson's office lodged 19 new charges against Kevorkian involving 10 deaths he has attended since June. Kevorkian has admitted being present at 45 suicides since he began his crusade to legalise assisted suicide in 1990.</p>
<p>Fieger warned Wednesday that Gorcyca would suffer Thompson's fate if he decided to go after his client.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Gorcyca is going to have a chance right now to decide whether he wants to go down the sinkhole that Richard Thompson started to engage in in 1992, which ended with him being thrown out of office,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Oakland County Circuit Judge Denise Langford-Morris set a scheduling hearing for Dec. 18 on a motion by prosecutors to hold Kevorkian in contempt of court. They allege that Kevorkian has repeatedly ignored a 1991 court order barring him from using his lethal injection machine.</p>
<p>Michigan lawmakers enacted a ban on physician-assisted suicide three years ago, except when it was meant to relieve pain and suffering. But the law expired in November 1994 and the legislature refused to renew it.</p>
<p>In December 1994 the Michigan Supreme Court ruled that assisted suicide was prohibited by the unwritten common law.</p>
<p>In addition to alleged common law violations, the most recent complaint includes charges not previously brought against Kevorkian, such as removing dead bodies without permission of the medical examiner and representing himself as a practicing physician while engaged in an unlawful act.</p>
