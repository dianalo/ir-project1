<title>USA: CME lumber futures pare limit gain at close.</title>
<headline>CME lumber futures pare limit gain at close.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-01-14</dateline>
<text>
<p>CME lumber futures eased from best levels by the close with March slipping from an earlier limit advance on renewed commercial pressure, traders said.</p>
<p>Futures closed $8.10 to $2.50 per thousand board feet higher paced by March at $411.70 per tbf. That month had posted a limit gain of $10.00 and limitless January was up as much as $11.50 before slipping to close $4.50 higher at $405.00 per tbf.</p>
<p>Short covering by cash-connected commission houses and locals drove prices up sharply before the renewed scattered commercial selling interest late. The market appeared oversold after falling from $433 to under $400 recently, traders said.</p>
<p>But weak cash lumber prices continued to weigh on the market. January, due to expire Wednesday, showed the largest setback from its high with March following by the close.</p>
<p>Cash spruce may be quoted lower Wednesday following reduced mill asking prices earlier in the week. High lumber prices and poor weather for building has kept demand slack, sources added.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices are still too high to accumulate spring inventory,&quot; said Curt Cunningham, President of Pacific Futures Trading.</p>
