<headline>Mexico peso closes firm on light dollar inflow.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1997-02-10</dateline>

<p>Mexican benchmark 48-hour peso contracts closed firmer for the third session in a row on Monday as a light flow of foreign capital continued to enter the Mexican markets, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a trickle of dollars from players who had gone long into the weekend, and from foreign investors buying on the secondary money market,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>The 48-hour peso and its 24-hour stablemate closed 1.05 and one centavo firmer, respectively, at 7.7930/7.7975 and 7.7920/7.7950 per dollar.  </p>
<p>Same-day peso contracts earlier closed 0.1 of a centavo weaker at 7.7890/7.7930 per dollar.</p>
<p>Traders said dealing was light due to stable U.S. long bond rates, as well as domestic inflation data being broadly within expectations.</p>
<p>&quot;January inflation was almost within expectations, which enhances confidence,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Banco de Mexico announced on Friday that consumer prices rose 2.57 percent in January.  The figures were released after the foreign exchange markets had closed and thus had no effect on trade that day.</p>
<p>A Reuters survey MXAAP of financial houses in Mexico City had shown an average prediction of 2.4 percent.</p>
<p>Yields on 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds stood at 6.71 percent, compared to 6.70 percent on Friday.</p>
<p>Dealers said they did not see the peso gaining more ground against the dollar this week because primary interest rates are expected to fall at Tuesday's weekly central bank auction.</p>
