<p>Germany's pay-TV market looked set to be reshaped on Monday when Bertlsmann and its Kirch Group rival said they would become equal partners in pay-television broadcaster Premiere, ending a long battle for position.</p>
<p>Bertelsmann's CLT-UFA affiliate and the Kirch Group said they had agreed to become 50-50 partners in Premiere.</p>
<p>France's Canal-Plus, which owns 37.5 percent of Premiere, is satisfied with the deal, a joint statement by Kirch and CLT-UFA said. Canal-Plus declined to comment on the report that it was selling out.</p>
<p>&quot;CLT-UFA and the Kirch Group agreed over the weekend to end the squabbles in the German pay-TV market and to pursue the development of pay-TV, particularly the digital market, together,&quot; the joint statement said.</p>
<p>Media mogul Leo Kirch holds 25 percent of Premiere, while CLT-UFA -- owned by Germany's Bertelsmann Group and GBL/Audiofina -- holds the remaining 37.5 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Only by combining our forces can the German digital market be developed on an internationally comparable scale in an economically sensible way.&quot;</p>
<p>Until now Premiere has been an uneasy alliance, with Kirch starting up his DF1 digital broadcaster to compete with Premiere. The joint statement does little to explain what the future relationship between Premiere and DF1 will be, except to say Premiere will also move in the digital direction.</p>
<p>The deal, if approved by cartel authorities and the two companies' supervisory boards, would allow the partners to move forward in developing Premiere as an up-market broadcaster of films and sports. Premiere, which now has over 1.5 million subscribers, aims for two million by mid-1998.</p>
<p>German cartel officials took a dim view of the plan, but ultimately it will likely be decided in Brussels.</p>
<p>As recently as last week, media reports said Kirch wanted to buy all of the Canal-Plus stake, giving it control of Premiere. But Kirch was also said to be in financial difficulties due to high start-up costs at its DF1 digital broadcaster, where subscriptions are lagging far below targets.</p>
<p>Canal-Plus is reportedly interested in acquiring Kirch's 45 percent stake in Italy's Telepiu to add to the 45 percent it already holds.</p>
<p>A Kirch spokesman acknowledged that talks were being held with Canal-Plus, but said the German and Italian stakes were not connected.</p>
<p>Under the deal, Kirch, which owns Europe's largest film library, would supply Premiere's film content and set-top decoder box, and develop Premiere as a digital broadcaster parallel to its DF1 digital station.</p>
<p>The partners continue to hold talks with Deutsche Telekom AG about tying the decoder technology into Telekom's cable network. They foresee an offering of over 50 digital channels and expect to reach the needed agreements in the next several weeks, they said.</p>
<p>German Cartel Office spokeswoman Elke Zeise said it was problematical that Germany's only two vendors in the pay-TV market planned to increase their cooperation.</p>
<p>&quot;That could cement the market relationships and make access more difficult for other vendors,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>European cartel authorities are likely to be responsible for deciding the case, however, given the scale of the partners' operations and the fact that Bertelsmann makes less than two-thirds of its European sales in Germany, she said.</p>
