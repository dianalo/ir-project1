<p>Serious Fraud Office director Chas Sturt on Thursday hit back at allegations that he canned an inquiry into the Bank of New Zealand in April 1993 because &quot;our friends in Wellington&quot; would not appreciate it. The issue was raised at the winebox Commission of Inquiry last week by SFO chief investigator Geoff Downey. After travelling to London to interview &quot;Mr B&quot; -- a former senior BNZ executive and an international banker of 25 years' experience -- Downey says Sturt suddenly put the clamps on any further investigation of the bank.

<p>A halt to the upward drift in mortgage rates should be the welcome outcome, after Reserve Bank governor Don Brash on Thursday advised the markets they could ease up a bit. Recently the market had sniffed a sanctioning of rising wholesale rates and bank margins had tightened to below 1.5 percent, generally, as the 90-day bill rate rose to 7.7 percent. Some institutions were raising mortgage rates. But Brash's remarks -- at the announcement of the RB's latest set of economic projections -- brought instant relief. Page 1.</p>

<p>Exchange rate concerns are being raised by some bank economists in response to Reserve Bank proposals to change the operating system underpinning the management of monetary policy. A discussion paper from the RB suggests technical changes to the way policy is implemented and intentions signalled. The RB says none of the canvassed issues affects the 0-3 percent inflation target, the way it assesses monetary conditions or the stance of monetary policy. They would affect the way policy is implemented and -- according to the RB -- would reduce the cost and administrative complexity of the system. Page 2.</p>

<p>Fletcher Energy will close its Indonesian operation at the end of this month after its five-year exploration for oil and gas reserves came to no avail. Fletcher refused to disclose how much the exercise has cost the company, but official statistics from Indonesian state oil company Pertamina indicate more than US$100 million has been spent on the exploration at four sites by Fletcher's project company, Petrocorp and its partner, Danish shipping and industrial giant Maersk. A Fletcher Energy official told The Independent the official figure was overstated. Page 3.</p>

<p>Over half (55 percent) of New Zealand's top 100 companies by market capitalisation are anticipating an increased number of senior executive redundancies in the coming year.</p>
<p>A greater number still (68 percent) are expecting to be taken to the Employment Court more often in the coming year than previously as a result of grievances over redundancies or dismissals. Page 3.</p>

<p>The threat of political intervention helped spur Trans Power and ECNZ to settle a $20 million dispute over the Cook Strait power cable. The state-owned enterprises are next week expected to sign a memorandum of understanding ending their seven-month stalemate. At issue was how much ECNZ should pay towards the cable's annual running costs.</p>

<p>Auckland's Kermadec restaurant, a fly in America's Cup village developer's ointment, withdrew its objection to the project after the Auckland Regional Services Trust (ARST) agreed to limit sponsors' activities. This limitation on corporate  </p>
<p>sponsors' commercial activities undermines the sponsors' benefits -- the reason for becoming a sponsor in the first place. It could also erode any revenue the ARST hopes to squeeze out of these sponsors. Terms of the deal were confidential. The ARST refused to comment when contacted by The Independent. Page 6.</p>
