<title>AUSTRALIA: Australian Commodities Roundup - June 2.</title>
<headline>Australian Commodities Roundup - June 2.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1996-06-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>Copper prices hit new one year highs on Friday but nickel slid to their lowest level in six weeks and gold eased after hitting 10-day high.</p>
<p>Oil traded little changed while wheat firmed in quiet trading. The CRB index closed three points lower at 250.96.</p>
<p>METALS</p>
<p>Copper prices lost touch with new one-year highs by the end of business while nickel slid to the lowest in six weeks after concerns about a weekend strike lifted. Building on this month's steady gains, three months copper pushed up to a fresh high of  </p>
<p>$2,548 per tonne in brisk ring afternoon trading on the LME. But end-of-week book squaring and profit-taking pushed prices lower by the end of the kerb. It ended at $2,529 per tonne, a gain of just $1 from Thursday's finish. Resistance of $2,550 will remain key, but in the case of a correction in current overbought conditions, strong support is expected at $2,515 and $2,500. Cash to threes backwardation eased by some $10 to $60/$70.</p>
<p>Nickel prices, meanwhile, plummeted to finish at a six-week low of $7,200, down $80, following news that Canadian nickel giant Inco Ltd had reached a tentative agreement with the union representing 4,700 workers at its Ontario division. Unionised  </p>
<p>workers were set to go on strike at midnight on Saturday, May 31, if a tentative agreement had not been reached.</p>
<p>&quot;Nickel has certainly not been helped by the tentative agreement, which makes it much less likely that there will be a strike. It was looking pretty shaky already,&quot; an analyst said. The union will still need to ratify the agreement. In the event of further losses next week, nickel will be eyeing support at $7,110, the low from mid-April.  </p>
<p>Aluminium failed to make any upside progress within its $1,610-$1,650 price range, despite a sizeable 4,250-tonne drop in LME stocks, and ended in the minus column. It was down $3 at $1,619, although off the day's lows.</p>
<p>Zinc also eased $12 to $1,345, with a rise in stocks and overbought technical indicators suggesting a downward correction may be in the offing. Lead was generally quiet but ended easier with the others at $633, down $7. Tin, initially blasted by fund selling on Thursday, ended still lower at $5,570, down $30.</p>
<p>GOLD  </p>
<p>COMEX and NYMEX precious metals futures ended lower Friday, led by profit taking in the platinum group metals (PGMs).</p>
<p>&quot;With gold and silver struggling a little of late, it was not too surprising that they weakened when the white metals sold off sharply today,&quot; said Scott Meyers, senior analyst with Pioneer Futures in New York.</p>
<p>COMEX August gold ended down $1.10 at $347.50 an ounce, after seeing a ten-day intraday high at $350.40 early.  </p>
<p>Funds were net short 30,237 lots in COMEX gold in the latest CFTC Commitment of Traders data on May 20, but had been seen covering some short positions this week, as gold prices recovered some ground on news of the threat to European Monetary Union, posed by the Bundesbank's opposition to the German government plan to revalue its gold reserves.</p>
<p>In the bullion market spot gold ended quoted $344.40/90 an ounce, compared to the London Friday afternoon fix at $345.60 and the New York close Thursday around $345.50/00.</p>
<p>OIL  </p>
<p>NYMEX crude oil futures prices ended mostly lower Friday after a quiet day of sideways trading, digesting the week's price swings with mild profit taking while awaiting some clear motivation. Crude oil for July delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange closed nine cents lower at $20.88 a barrel after rising 18 cents on Thursday. Traders will keep one eye on the United Nations next week. With a week to go before the Iraqi-U.N oil-for-food accord expires, the first steps for renewing the deal will occur on Monday, when Secretary General Kofi Annan submit his recommendation on the pact's renewal to the Security Council.  </p>
<p>WHEAT</p>
<p>CBOT soft red winter wheat futures closed higher on export news and gains in soybeans. But trading was quiet and the volume was thin as the wheat market Friday consolidated after a week of volatile dealings. Gains were limited by the approach of U.S. winter wheat harvesting amid recent improvements in crop condition ratings. Also weather in France, Australia and the U.S. recently turned more conducive to wheat crop production. CBOT soft red winter wheat futures closed two cents per bushel higher to one lower, with July up two at $3.60-1/2.  </p>
<p>SUGAR</p>
<p>CSCE July world sugar futures closed weaker and near the day's lows, but prices remained within their recent trading range amid thin volume. Most-active July settled 0.04 cent lower at 11.17 cents per lb, having traded from 11.15 to 11.25 cents.</p>
