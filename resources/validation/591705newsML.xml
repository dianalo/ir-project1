<p>By Russell Barton (ABC TV Political Editor)</p>
<p>Question: &quot;Do you think the budget will cut through what's been described as the fog?&quot;</p>
<p>Prime Minister John Howard: &quot;That was my description. That's the trouble, you make these comments and they keep being used.&quot;</p>
<p>That's the trouble all right. Damn journalists. Always quoting your words back to you as though you meant them.</p>
<p>That little exchange between a Melbourne radio talk-back host, and the prime minister on Wednesday morning -- the beginning of the big budget sales pitch -- illustrates just how rattled Howard has become since he passed his first anniversary in office.</p>
<p>The government's plunge in the opinion polls has been matched by a steep dets self-confidence.</p>
<p>Now suddenly level-pegging with Labor in the polls, the coalition was looking to the budget to pierce the fog, to use the prime minister's word.</p>
<p>But what has the budget produced, politically? In short, Initially, Treasurer Peter Costello's second budget looked so benign that it would struggle to last the week in the public mind. That judgement proved awry, but for the wrong reasons, as far as the government is concerned.</p>
<p>With spending cuts now unfashionable (impact next financial year A$313 million), the centrepiece had to be the savings rebate initiative (impact A$1.4 billion at its peak in 1999/2000). This received a mauling from the same commentators who last year applauded the structural reshaping in the first Costello document.</p>
<p>On that first day of the sales campaign, Costello was in fine fettle, trumpeting the fact that he would be the treasurer who turned a A$10 billion &quot;black hole&quot; into a A$1 billion plus surplus in one parliamentary term. He would also be the man who started repaying debt.</p>
<p>In addition, he argued the case for the savings rebate: &quot;This is a major initiative in the Australian taxation system. It's not been done before. For the first time our tax system says it's good to save. Not only has this government moved from borrowing to saving, what we now want to do with tax incentives, with choices open to people, is we want to give encouragement to savings as well.&quot;</p>
<p>And he argued the equity of the rebate. &quot;This savings rebate is also very progressive. It's progressive because it's a flat 15 percent rebate off the marginal tax rate. If you happen to be on a 20 percent tax rate, three quarters of the tax on savings is abolished.&quot;</p>
<p>At the same time, Howard was arguing the case for making it universal, despite the coalition's original policy declaring any savings tax break would be means tested.</p>
<p>But then in the House of Representatives Question Time came Howard's unprompted admission to Opposition leader Kim Beazley: &quot;I ought to tell the honourable gentleman that I will not be claiming it -- and it is up to you not to claim it. Are you going to make an equivalent promise. No.&quot;</p>
<p>Howard had been quizzed on this point on a couple of talk-back radio programmes that morning. &quot;Leave me out of it,&quot; he said. But by the afternoon it seemed to be looming larger in his mind.</p>
<p>The concession caused eyes to roll on Howard's front bench and prompted an impromptu conference between the senior ministers around Howard's chair.</p>
<p>An explanation was sought by reporters after Question Time.</p>
<p>The answer from the prime minister's office was that he would forego the rebate because he was provided with two taxpayer-funded residences.</p>
<p>The parliament, and the public, was left with the impression that the prime minister was embarrassed about the universality of the budget initiative and, as the Opposition put it, was adopting a &quot;do it yourself means test&quot;.</p>
<p>It was a totally unnecessary and unexpected gift for Labor which up until that point had been struggling to make an impression on the budget.</p>
<p>It had been concentrating, ineffectually, on the abandonment of Paul Keating's L.A.W. tax cuts, which were subsequently turned into a superannuation co-payment.</p>
<p>The fact is hardly anyone believed they would ever see the earmaked A$4.5 billion in any form.</p>
<p>And the super payment was too nebulous to have an impression on the electorate.</p>
<p>Slightly more effective was the Oppositon's attack on the budget's lack of attention to employment.</p>
<p>In the medium term, this is Labor's best line of attack and the weakest section of the government's battlements.</p>
<p>The budget's forecast for an improvement in the unemployment rate from 8.75 per cent now to eight percent at the end of next financial year appears heroic against the forecast GDP growth of 3.75 percent.</p>
<p>And the budget carried this warning: &quot;An acceleration in employment growth should encourage more people to seek work during 1997/98 so that not all of the increase in employment will translate into lower unemployment.&quot;</p>
<p>The government urgently needs a political strategy for dealing with the jobless problem. Without it, the current slide will not be arrested.</p>
