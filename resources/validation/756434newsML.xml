<p>South Africa's gold mining industry is suffering from low bullion prices, but a warning by East Rand Proprietary Mines Ltd that it could close was not an ominous sign for the industry, analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>ERPM said on Thursday the current low gold price and lower-than-expected underground yields combined to form a real risk that the mine could close in the near future.</p>
<p>&quot;Whilst management has made certain proposals to government and discussions are taking place, there remains a strong possibility of ceasing operations in the near future,&quot; the mine said in a cautionary annoucement.</p>
<p>Analysts said ERPM -- managed by Randgold and Exploration Co Ltd -- had been a candidate for closure for several years.</p>
<p>&quot;ERPM has battled for many, many years and has been supported by funds from shareholders...and loans from institutions underwritten by the government,&quot; HSBC Simpson Mckie analyst Dave Giese said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a very old mine, a very deep mine, a very costly mine in which to operate and to all intents and purposes it has been uneconomical to mine for many years,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>ERPM made a net loss of 11.14 million rand ($2.4 million) before capital expenditure in the March quarter compared to 18.68 million rand profit in the preceding quarter.</p>
<p>E.W. Balderson metals analyst Stephen Briggs said the threat of ERPM's closure should not be seen as a dark omen for the South African industry -- the world's biggest gold producer.</p>
<p>&quot;On balance, this isn't a harbinger of things to come. There will be the odd very obvious high-cost candidates which will close but the bulk of the business will survive,&quot; Briggs said.</p>
<p>South African gold mines are the deepest in the world, and are digging deeper and at higher cost to reach ore.</p>
<p>The country's Chamber of Mines has said that at least nine gold mines -- employing around 63,000 people -- could be classified as marginal.</p>
<p>Despite the current price environment, major mining houses have posted good results for the three months to end-June in the quarterly reporting season now underway.</p>
<p>Anglo American Corp of South Africa Ltd's available profits from its gold mines in the June quarter dropped by two percent to 220.7 million rand and the company said it was financially sound despite the weak bullion price.</p>
<p>Gold was last trading around $324 an ounce, some $67 below last year's average price. The yellow metal hit a 12-year low of $314 earlier this month in the wake of fresh central bank sales.</p>
<p>Analysts registered surprise at the quarterly results reported to date by mining, but warned that the outlook for the third quarter is be grim.</p>
<p>They said bullion's latest price plunge began in early July and this would impact on those South African mines not protected to some degree by hedging in the third quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;One has to take into consideration these results reflect the economic environment three months ago which obviously was better than it is today.</p>
<p>&quot;It appears to be a pleasant surprise but one must be cautious when looking out from here because the mines will be operating under the current low gold environment which is going to put additional pressure on the marginal operations,&quot; Giese said.</p>
