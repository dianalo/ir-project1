<p>Confirmed new nickel projects around the world in the next five years are estimated to total some 200,000 tonnes of finished metal, the International Nickel Study Group said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The figure updated an estimate issued last year that did not include the massive Voisey Bay project in Canada.</p>
<p>Voisey Bay had now been incorporated into the statistics, but additional projects not yet fully confirmed continued to be excluded.</p>
<p>The latest estimate was taken from the INSG's Annual Survey of Nickel Industry Developments and was contained in a brief statement issued by the group after a two-day closed-door meeting in The Hague.</p>
<p>The INSG said a wide range of issues concerning nickel statistics was discussed.</p>
<p>The talks recognised gaps in the detailed figures on trade and production of ferronickel. Additional data would be given by members to the group, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;The importance of such data has increased owing to threats to the quality of import data, notably among members of the European Union,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>The group also revised its full-year 1996 supply and demand totals, saying consumption reached 927,000 tonnes</p>
<p>Stocks held by the London Metal Exchange and nickel producers declined by 5,000 tonnes in the year, it said, adding complete data on stocks held elsewhere were not yet available.</p>
<p>The INSG, which groups industry advisers from around the world, will hold its next meeting in The Hague on October 16-17.</p>
