<p>American Steve Stricker left holder Ernie Els with a mountain to climb by seizing a six-hole lead halfway through their 36-hole second round encounter at the World Matchplay championship on Friday.</p>
<p>The unseeded Stricker, who on Thursday knocked out Els's victim in last year's final, Australian Steve Elkington, continued his fine work by exploiting two early errors from the South African and then firing four birdies in the space of seven holes in mid-round.</p>
<p>By the turn he was three up, further birdies at the 12th and 13th put him five ahead and he birdied the last two holes as well.</p>
<p>Els, the top seed, landed his only birdie at the last hole.</p>
<p>&quot;I didn't play well. I had no confidence this morning,&quot; said Els, whose one-over-par 73 was the first time he had not beaten par in seven rounds at this event.</p>
<p>&quot;I played as bad as I could have played and I had some bad luck as well,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Stricker, who had an approximate 66 with one putt conceded, was pleased with his birdie chances but said it was difficult to keep his mind on the task.</p>
<p>&quot;I have just got to pay attention to the subject at the moment and I can't get ahead of myself. I have just got to keep playing hard,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>U.S. Open champion Steve Jones was also under pressure from Vijay Singh, who was three ahead at lunch.</p>
<p>But British Open champion Tom Lehman, who played a Skins game in 32 degrees Celsius on Monday and Tuesday, survived a wet and chilly morning that forced a delay of one hour 45 minutes to take control against Mark O'Meara. He was two up at lunch.</p>
<p>U.S. PGA champion Mark Brooks led European number one Colin Montgomerie by one hole at the break.</p>
<p>Els, who along with the three major champions had a first round bye, bogeyed the third and fourth holes, missing the third green and finding trees at the fourth.</p>
<p>He got one back with a par at the fifth when Stricker took his only bogey. Then Els, who turned 27 on Thursday, rattled off 11 more pars in succession.</p>
<p>But Stricker birdied five of those holes with solid iron play and strong putting to lead by six playing the last.</p>
<p>Jones began disastrously against Singh, the conqueror of Phil Mickelson on Thursday, by missing the first green and then three-putting from 10 feet for a double-bogey six.</p>
<p>Further bogeys at the fifth and seventh were costly but Jones steadied on the back nine, though he lost the 17th before winning the 18th with a birdie.</p>
<p>Montgomerie holed a 60-footer from off the green for an eagle three at the fourth against Brooks.</p>
<p>Both came unstuck at the sixth and the hole was halved in double bogey sixes.</p>
<p>Brooks four-putted from the bottom of the two-tier green when he did not get his first putt up the hill and Montgomerie needed two attempts to escape from a bunker and then missed the green.</p>
<p>It was only the fourth time in the 33-year history of the event that a hole had been halved in double bogeys.</p>
