<p>Britain's Labour government said on Tuesday its constructive new approach to Europe was on the verge of securing a crucial deal on border controls which eluded its Conservative predecessors.</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said a meeting of European foreign ministers had confirmed that Labour's landslide election victory three weeks ago had produced a &quot;substantial transformation&quot; in the negotiating atmosphere.</p>
<p>&quot;I did not come to The Hague like Conservative ministers before in order to wreck a deal. I came to get a deal, a good deal for Britain and a good deal for Europe,&quot; said Cook, fresh from talks with U.S. officials in Washington.</p>
<p>Labour's new approach was beginning to clear away the obstacles to a deal at the June Amsterdam summit on key reforms to the way Europe works.</p>
<p>Continental European states are keen to speed up transit across their land borders. But Britain has argued that as an island, it must keep control of its frontiers.</p>
<p>The issue became a key argument in Britain's May 1 election, with the defeated Conservatives arguing that Labour would give in to pressure from Europe.</p>
<p>But Cook said: &quot;I am hopeful that at Amsterdam we will get the agreement we seek which will enable Britain not only to retain its external frontier controls but to retain them with a very clear legal authority, something the previous Conservative government never achieved.&quot;</p>
<p>Labour has embarked on a diplomatic drive to convince Britain's European partners its election will signify a more constructive approach.</p>
<p>As a signal of intent, Labour has already said it will sign up to the EU's Social Chapter laying down common levels of protection for workers across Europe -- which former prime minister John Major opted out of.</p>
<p>But Labour is still anxious to counter Conservative charges that it will be duped into making major concessions before it has understood the full implications of what is at stake.</p>
<p>&quot;The steps we have taken have not been steps designed in order to please people on the continent. They have been steps taken because we believe they are good for Britain,&quot; Cook told a news conference after the informal meeting of EU ministers.</p>
<p>&quot;They do, of course, have the effect of bringing us closer to mainstream continental opinion and by doing so narrow the areas of divisions between us and that is why we believe we are going to get a better deal than the Conservatives could in Amsterdam because we are able to focus on the areas of real importance to Britain.&quot;</p>
<p>Dutch foreign minister Hans van Mierlo confirmed there were real chances of a deal at Amsterdam thanks mainly to what he described as the constructive approach of the new government.</p>
<p>But German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel gave the first signs Labour's honeymoon in Europe may be coming to an end.</p>
<p>&quot;The British have moved, but there are points where it would be nice if they moved a bit more,&quot; he told reporters.</p>
