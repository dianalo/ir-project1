<p>The strongest civilian challenger to Gambia's military leader Yahya Jammeh powered ahead on Friday after three constituencies were declared in the West African country's presidential election.</p>
<p>Latest official results announced live on television just after midnight showed chief opposition leader Ousainou Darboe had polled a total of 4,293 ballots, against Jammeh's 3,995. Darboe outpolled Jammeh by 1,183 ballots in one constituency alone -- Keang East in the interior.</p>
<p>The results appear in line with predictions of a close race between Darboe, a popular Banjul lawyer who is leader of the United Democratic Party, and Jammeh, who overthrew an elected government in a 1994 coup.</p>
<p>Darboe's performance would also reinforce fears of how the military will react if Jammeh loses. Experts say flaws in a constitution promoted by Jammeh and adopted in a referendum last month could delay a handover of power if the opposition wins, creating conditions for unrest.</p>
<p>The new constitution does not come into force until it is approved by parliament, which will not be in place before December after general elections.</p>
<p>Jammeh's AFPRC ruling council remains in power until the new constitution comes into force -- which will not happen before parliament is elected -- and there is no legal provision as to when the elected president is sworn in.</p>
<p>&quot;If Jammeh wins then there is no problem as he will just continue in office,&quot; said a legal expert in Banjul. &quot;But there could be a problem if Darboe wins and expects to be sworn in tomorrow. His supporters may not understand this.&quot;</p>
<p>The Commonwealth and the United Nations described the electoral law and constitutional arrangements as flawed and called off plans to send observers for the poll.</p>
<p>&quot;The transition is so awkwardly designed that it leaves complete control in the hands of the AFPRC,&quot; a Western diplomat said, adding: &quot;This is a recipe for a particularly unstable situation.&quot;</p>
<p>Jammeh, candidate of the Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and Construction, had taken an early lead after the first result was declared from Janjanbureh, the smallest constituency. There are a total of 45 constituencies in the country of one million people.</p>
<p>Two other civilian candidates appeared to be doing better with each new result but still remained largely marginal to the race, predicted as essentially between Jammeh and Darboe.</p>
<p>They are hotel manager Amath Bah of the National Reconciliation Party (NRP) and Sidia Jatta of the small People's Democratic Organisation for Independence and Socialism.</p>
<p>Final results are expected late on Friday.</p>
