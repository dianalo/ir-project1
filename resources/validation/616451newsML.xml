<p>Supervisors at Codelco's Chuquicamata copper mine voted Tuesday to accept a company pay offer but a sizable minority of votes in favor of striking showed there was only grudging acceptance of the deal, union leaders said.</p>
<p>A total of 354 agreed to accept the new four-year wage contract and 196 voted to strike out of 553 votes cast, said a union spokesmen at the mine, Codelco's largest.  </p>
<p>&quot;I think it's good that so many workers voted against the pay offer because it shows we are unhappy with many aspects of it,&quot; said Grimaldo Ponce, president of the 670-member supervisors' union.</p>
<p>Still, most workers at assembly in Chuquicamata said the wages offered in the contract were good and that they were happy with the agreement apart from the health insurance provisions.</p>
<p>&quot;The result of this vote indicates that the wage offer is good,&quot; said Ponce.  </p>
<p>He said workers were unhappy with a provision of the pay contract awarding health care -- currently the responsibility of Codelco -- to a private insurance company created by Codelco.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a question of principles here. We don't want a private health insurance group running our health care. It is a historical aberration.&quot; said a worker, who declined to give his name and said he voted against the wage contract.</p>
<p>The new wage contract is the first ever reached by collective bargaining between management and the supervisors' union.</p>
<p>The company offered a four-year contract including a 3.5 percent real wage rise, plus a further nine percent rise conditional on reaching production targets.</p>
<p>Chuquicamata's 7,000 miners went on strike for 10 days last year after scheduled wage talks broke down.</p>
<p>The mine, the largest of Codelco's four mining divisions, produced 632,000 tonnes of fine copper in 1996.</p>
