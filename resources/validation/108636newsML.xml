<p>Afghanistan's purist Islamic Taleban militia appeared in deep trouble on Thursday as they suffered further losses in the Salang Pass north of Kabul and prepared defences south of the front line.</p>
<p>Travellers from Jabal-os-Siraj, at the entrance to Salang Pass through the Hindu Kush where forces of the ousted Rabbani government were hitting the Taleban hard, said the fighting was close to the town.</p>
<p>In Charikar, 60 km (40 miles) north of Kabul and a half-hour drive south of Jabal-os-Siraj, people said there had been small arms fire some five km (three miles) away and they believed the front line was there.</p>
<p>But Reuter reporters heard no sound of gunfire or signs of retreat in the mid-afternoon and there was no word in the town on whether Jabal-os-Siraj had fallen.</p>
<p>In Kabul aid workers said they heard rumours Jabal-os-Siraj had been taken, but there was no confirmation.</p>
<p>If there was no sign of retreat in Charikar, through which people said dozens of Taleban dead and wounded had been ferried during the day, there were distinct signs of impending trouble.</p>
<p>Taleban fighters were setting up anti-aircraft guns in the middle of the road through the town, shops were shuttered and people said they were seriously worried.</p>
<p>At nearby Bagram, next to Kabul's military airport, the village was virtually deserted and a house was on fire.</p>
<p>Raihau Gull, a member of the family that owned the house, said Taleban set it on fire in retaliation for an attack nearby in the the night in which she said several Taleban died.</p>
<p>The airport was still in Taleban hands and there was no sign of fighting near it.</p>
<p>But in a further sign of Taleban nervousness in the area, fighters asked reporters who controlled Charikar and relaxed a little when told the Taleban still did.</p>
<p>There was nervousness in Kabul where the price of the Afghani, a usually reliable barometer of security fears in 17 years of war which has ravaged the country, rose to 17,000 to the dollar from 14,000 before the Salang fighting on Tuesday.</p>
<p>As Western aid workers met to discuss contingency evacuation measures, the Taleban rejected on Thursday calls by U.N. special envoy Norbert Holl for a ceasefire, saying they would not lay down their weapons until all Afghans disarmed.</p>
<p>Holl earlier told Reuters he was meeting Taleban officials and planned to meet those of other factions, to call for a ceasefire after fighting broke out north of Kabul.</p>
<p>Pakistan, widely seen as wielding influence on the Taleban movement although it denies sponsoring the Islamic movement, called in Islamabad for a broad-based government in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>&quot;We are pursuing the idea of a broad-based government in principle, because we do not see how a single ethnic group or religious group, or any single group, can actually dominate Afghanistan in the long run,&quot; a Foreign Ministry spokesman said.</p>
<p>The spokesman said Pakistan wanted all of Afghanistan's neighbours to help end the conflict there and back the formation of a broad-based government through an intra-Afghan dialogue.</p>
<p>He said Pakistan had been in contact with powerful Uzbek chief General Abdul Rashid Dostum, who controls six northern provinces, but gave no details. Pakistan had also been in touch with Russia, Iran, Turkey and Central Asian states.</p>
<p>The Salang attack has been a severe blow to the Taleban after its capture of Kabul just two weeks ago. Afghan watchers in the capital said their military position may be unravelling.</p>
<p>Witnesses have reported seeing hundreds of casualties being evacuated from the Salang since the attack was launched by Basir Solangi, the government commander in the pass who had retreated north to territory run by Dostum.</p>
<p>Solangi, loyal to former government army chief Ahmad Shah Masood, cut off a large Taleban force and caused many casualties among them and among reinforcements sent up to help.</p>
<p>Witnesses said the front line of largely ethnic Pushtun Taleban forces was pushed back on Tuesday at least 15 km (nine miles). On Wednesday the sound of the fighting reported by the travellers suggested it had been driven back even further.</p>
<p>The attack relieved pressure on Masood, who had been bottled up in his Pansjher Valley fortress, which runs northeast from Jabal-os-Siraj.</p>
<p>Witnesses said Taleban fighters and heavy weaponry, unable to break through the narrow gorge into the Panjsher in five days of fighting, were switched to the Salang front.</p>
<p>To add to Taleban woes, there were growing signs of a formal alliance between their foes in Mazar-i-Sharif, the northern city from which Dostum controls six of Afghanistan's 33 provinces.</p>
<p>Ousted president Burhanuddin Rabbani and Karim Khallili, head of the Shia Moslem Hezb-i-Wahadat group, were both there.</p>
<p>Khallili controls territory west of Jabal-os-Siraj, and Masood could attack from the Panjsher as well as the Salang.</p>
<p>If Dostum were to throw his well-trained army and small air force into the fray, Kabul would be vulnerable with no signs of major Taleban defences between Jabal-os-Siraj and the capital.</p>
<p>But the Taleban seemed serious about defending Jabal-os-Siraj, gathering mobile missile launchers, tanks and artillery behind the town.</p>
