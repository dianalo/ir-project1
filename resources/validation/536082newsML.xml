<p>The German government on Thursday said sweeping reforms to the outdated tax system might have to be postponed a year after talks with the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) collapsed on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Commentators said the tax stalemate, as well as raising serious doubts over Bonn's ability to pass much-needed reforms, could hit economic growth and hinder efforts to slash borrowing to qualify for European economic and monetary union (EMU).</p>
<p>Chancellor Helmut Kohl's right-hand man Wolfgang Schaeuble said cuts in corporate taxes planned for next year might have to be rolled into one tax-cutting package to take effect in 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be worth considering postponing reductions in corporate tax,&quot; he said, adding that cuts in pension charges could instead be brought forward a year to 1998.</p>
<p>Coalition leaders said a planned two-point cut in the 7.5 percent solidarity surcharge, raised to rebuild eastern Germany, would still take place in 1998 since it did not need the approval of the SPD's majority in the upper house of parliament.</p>
<p>&quot;The cut in the solidarity surcharge has been promised and will come,&quot; said Michael Glos, parliamentary leader of Finance Minister Theo Waigel's Christian Social Union (CSU).</p>
<p>Schaeuble's comments were the only initiative to emerge after talks between the Kohl coalition and the SPD on Waigel's plan to cut 30 billion marks ($17.5 billion) in tax collapsed.</p>
<p>President Roman Herzog, in a rare political intervention, urged politicians to act quickly to fight unemployment. German dole queues, which peaked at a post-war record 4.7 million in the winter, are lengthening by a third of a million a year.</p>
<p>&quot;We must act now, instead of just talking,&quot; Herzog said.</p>
<p>Newspapers poured scorn on the stalemate, with the Bild daily slamming it as &quot;third-rate political theatre&quot; and asking whether Germans would ever get a tax cut.</p>
<p>The collapse of the talks means the government will have to push tax legislation through the usual parliamentary channels.</p>
<p>Waigel expects his tax bills to clear the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, before the summer break. The SPD-controlled upper chamber, the Bundesrat, would then bounce the measures back to parliament's mediation committee.</p>
<p>There, the two antagonists would have to try again to thrash out a deal. But both sides said chances had fallen of reaching a deal before general election scheduled for October 1998.</p>
<p>The SPD's spokesman on the mediation committee, Peter Struck, told the Leipziger Volkszeitung newspaper that he had great doubts that a tax deal could be reached in parliamentary mediation.</p>
<p>Economists warned that continuing uncertainty over the future cost of doing business in Germany could have potentially disastrous economic effects.</p>
<p>Dieter Vesper of the DIW economic institute said the failure of the tax talks was &quot;poison for the economy&quot;. He told the Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung that Germany would struggle this year to meet the government's growth forecast of 2.5 percent.</p>
<p>That could also be fatal for Germany's bid to qualify for EMU. Although Waigel has promised to meet the Maastricht treaty deficit target of three percent of GDP this year, independent economists say Germany will overshoot.</p>
<p>Germany's authoritative six economic institutes this week predicted the deficit would be up to 3.2 percent of GDP, while the International Monetary Fund saw the shortfall at 3.3 percent.</p>
<p>The SPD has forecast the deficit would be 3.4 percent in 1997 because tax revenues would fall 20 billion marks short of target and unemployment costs would exceed budgeted levels by 10 billion marks.</p>
<p>&quot;Waigel's only choice left is between plague and cholera,&quot; SPD budget spokesman Karl Diller said. &quot;Either to raise taxes drastically or to break constitutional limits on borrowing and overshoot the Maastricht deficit target.&quot;</p>
