<p>Ousted Zairean president Mobutu Sese Seko and his family have arrived in the Moroccan capital Rabat aboard three Gabonese aircraft, a senior Moroccan security official said on Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;Mobutu and his family arrived aboard three airplanes discreetly in the Rabat military airport. Mobutu and his family will stay at the 50-room Amphitrite hotel,&quot; the official told Reuters.</p>
<p>The hotel is situated some 20 km (12 miles) south of Rabat on the Atlantic coast close to the royal palace of Skhirat.</p>
<p>&quot;Three Gabonese aircraft transported Mobutu and his family to the Rabat military airport thanks to the cooperation of Moroccan authorities,&quot; said the official.</p>
<p>He could not say how long Mobutu would be staying in Morocco.</p>
<p>Reporters, photographers and television crews had been waiting for Mobutu to arrive at Rabat's civilian airport.</p>
<p>Earlier, a Reuters correspondent saw an unusual deployment of security forces around the Amphitrite hotel.</p>
<p>&quot;The hotel was booked for Mobutu and his family... Therefore it is now not open to the public,&quot; said a Moroccan official.</p>
<p>The hotel is near a clean and beautiful Atlantic beach and is close to the highway linking the Moroccan business centre of Casablanca to the political capital of Rabat, where Morocco's King Hassan II lives.</p>
