<p>Holding his small niece in his arms, Tito Viali stared out at the fog-shrouded Pacific where the Aeroperu Boeing 757-200 carrying his wife crashed on Wednesday into the sea soon after taking off from Lima.</p>
<p>&quot;There is still hope,&quot; he said, sobbing quietly. &quot;There is still hope.&quot;</p>
<p>Viali had arrived before dawn at a barren strip of highway on the coast, along with several other relatives of the 70 passengers and crew on the Peruvian airline's flight 603 to Santiago, Chile.</p>
<p>While Viali expressed hope, officials in Lima said all aboard had been killed.</p>
<p>Rescue officials and relatives had arrived on the scene -- an eerie 500-yard (500-meter) stretch of highway cutting through the sand dunes along the coast -- soon after news broke that the aircraft had gone down.</p>
<p>Also on hand was a van from a national chain of undertakers, A. Merino. The vehicle's driver said he was there to transport bodies to the nearest village, a job that was becoming familiar to him.</p>
<p>&quot;We have another horrible tragedy on our hands. This is becoming a habit for me,&quot; he said, explaining he had been at the site of the crash of another Peruvian aircraft in the city of Arequipa seven months ago. That accident killed 123 people on a flight operated by the Faucett airline.</p>
<p>As the fog lifted after dawn, street hawkers joined the silent, sombre crowd, selling soft drinks and biscuits.</p>
<p>Dotted along the brown dunes, about 150 fire and police officials stared blankly through the drizzle at the waves.</p>
<p>As traffic along the coastal highway picked up during the morning, buses stopped occasionally to let their passengers out and gaze out to sea.</p>
<p>They saw nothing of the crash remains. But rescue aircraft spotted pieces of the fuselage and hopes for survivors dwindled until the airline announced no one had survived.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at Lima's international airport, relatives gathered for confirmation of the news, while in Santiago, dozens of family members waited in stunned silence as the word &quot;canceled&quot; flickered onto the screen for flight number 603.</p>
