<p>Philippine food and drinks firm RFM Corp said on Monday it was confident it would meet its net income forecast of 880 million pesos this year.</p>
<p>RFM's meat processing arm, Swift Foods Inc, said it expected to meet and even exceed its 1997 net income target of around 83 million pesos.  </p>
<p>&quot;This year will be a banner year for RFM in terms of sales and earnings,&quot; RFM president Jose Concepcion said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;Hopefully, this will be the beginning of more rapid, stable, predictable earnings growth as we continue to see the increasing contributions of our branded value added businesses to the revenue and income stream of the company.&quot;</p>
<p>RFM reported a 106 percent increase in net income in the first six months of the year to 453 million pesos from the year-ago 220 million.</p>
<p>It attributed the increase in its income to &quot;unprecedented&quot; profit performance of its beverage subsidiary Cosmos Bottling corp and RFM's flour, milk and juices divisions.</p>
<p>&quot;With these results, company officials are confident that RFM will make or even exceed its 1997 net income goal of 880 million pesos,&quot; Concepcion said.  </p>
<p>Meat processing firm Swift Foods, the largest subsidiary of RFM, said it also expected a strong rebound in its earnings this year.</p>
<p>&quot;We are confident that Swift will meet and even exceed its 1997 target of around 83 million pesos,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Swift reported a 40-million peso net income in the first half of the year compared to the year-ago loss of 10 million pesos.</p>
<p>The firm attributed its strong turn-around to firmer chicken prices and its continued dominance as the leading supplier to the expanding fastfood sector.</p>
