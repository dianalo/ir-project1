<p>NABLUS, West Bank, Sept 23 (Reuter ) - Palestinian police opened fire on rioting fans during a soccer match in PLO-ruled Nablus on Monday killing one man and seriously wounding two others, eyewitnesses said.</p>
<p>Palestinian officials said a committee of inquiry was formed and that the police officers involved were to be detained. They said President Yasser Arafat had cancelled all soccer games pending the committee's findings.</p>
<p>Eyewitnesses said the shooting took place during a match between a Tulkarm team and one from East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>&quot;The referee called a goal for the Jerusalem team and the players from the Tulkarm team got angry and started hitting him,&quot; said Hani Sulwein, 63, one of the fans who was shot and wounded. Sulwein had the bullet removed and was in serious but stable condition.</p>
<p>&quot;At the same time fans of the Tulkarm team started throwing stones and empty bottles at the referee and his assistants. It was then that the police opened fire and I was hit in the stomach.&quot;</p>
<p>Nablus Governor Mahmoud Aloul said such incidents had happened throughout the world.</p>
<p>&quot;We have formed an inquiry committee to look into what caused the incident. Soccer games have been cancelled until further notice on the order of President Arafat,&quot; Aloul said in a statement.</p>
