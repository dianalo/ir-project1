<title>USA: Ralston Purina Q3 pet products profit up.</title>
<headline>Ralston Purina Q3 pet products profit up.</headline>
<dateline>ST. LOUIS, Mo. 1997-07-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>Ralston Purina Co said Monday operating profit for its pet products division increased in the fiscal third quarter, although higher pet food volumes were partially offset by increased promotion.</p>
<p>For the first nine months of fiscal 1997, operating profit for pet products was flat, as increased pet food volume and pricing were offset by higher ingredient costs and promotion support.</p>
<p>Ralston did not break out results for its divisions.  </p>
<p>Overall, Ralston reported earnings for the third quarter ended June 30 of $0.96 a primary share, compared with $0.77 a year ago. Excluding items, quarterly operating earnings were $0.90 a share, up from $0.79.</p>
<p>Battery products' operating profit fell in the quarter, but improved slightly in the first nine months.</p>
<p>Positive factors included increased worldwide alkaline battery volume and improved results in the Asia-Pacific region. Negative factors included decreased volumes and earnings in Europe, start-up costs associated with the lithium ion rechargeable battery and decreased original equipment manufacturer rechargeable sales in the Asia Pacific region due to competitive pricing.</p>
<p>Soy protein products' operating profit decreased in the quarter and nine months, as higher volumes and selling prices were more than offset by higher costs of raw materials and business development and management, as well as unfavorable foreign exchange.</p>
<p>Agricultural products' profit increased in the quarter and nine months on favorable margins and increased volume in the Asia-Pacific region, partially offset by decreased volume and lower margins in South and Central America.</p>
