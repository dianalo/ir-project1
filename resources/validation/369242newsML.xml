<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin is recovering slowly from pneumonia, which hit him while he was still shaky after heart surgery, and he will not return to the Kremlin quickly, his press secretary said on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>&quot;The rehabilitation goes rather slowly,&quot; Sergei Yastrzhembsky told a Kremlin briefing.</p>
<p>&quot;Although the president is getting better little by little, including in his physical activity which is shown by the greater number of meetings and a more intense work schedule, I want to repeat that we should not expect a speedy return to the Kremlin.&quot;</p>
<p>Yeltsin was taken to hospital with pneumonia on January 8, two weeks after his return to the Kremlin following a quintuple heart bypass operation on November 5. He has made several brief visits to the Kremlin in recent weeks but spends most of his time at his Gorky-9 country residence.</p>
<p>When Yeltsin went down with pneumonia the Kremlin doctors said it would take him about six weeks to recuperate.</p>
