<title>HONG KONG: Hong Kong gold ends up on buying, shortcovering.</title>

<dateline>HONG KONG 1996-11-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>Hong Kong gold ended up on Wednesday from its previous New York close on marginal buying interest from Japan and limited local shortcovering, gold traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;A slightly lower dollar/yen prompted some buying from Japanese traders,&quot; said a gold source at an international bank.</p>
<p>Japanese traders frequently arbitrage between the Tokyo Commodity Exchange (TOCOM) and the spot gold market.</p>
<p>Some Hong Kong dealers who were short with Japanese traders covered their positions in the afternoon, pushing the spot price up slightly, another gold trader said.</p>
<p>Gold remained clouded by bearish sentiment and uncertainty over market direction, feeling pressure from more news of proposed International Monetary Fund gold sales, bullion dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;People are mostly holding onto short positions for the time being to see if any key decisions are announced,&quot; said a gold trader at an international bank's local office.</p>
<p>Gold traded within a tight range but would likely try the downside, bullion traders said.  </p>
<p>Physical demand was seen faltering in the short term, with little interest from consumers in Hong Kong and Taiwan, but gold traders remained hopeful of healthier demand in January and February.</p>
<p>Bullion ended at US$378.25/75 an ounce on Wednesday against New York's $377.85/378.25 close on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Local gold ended HK$2 lower at HK$3,487 a tael.</p>
<p>The carryover charge at the Chinese Gold and Silver Exchange Society rose sharply to -0.01 from its previous fix at -5.00.</p>
<p>&quot;It shows there are no big positions at the exchange,&quot; said a senior gold dealer.</p>
