<p>CSCE world sugar was called to open mostly unchanged Wednesday, with players expected to focus on the May expiry, trading sources said.</p>
<p>Some analysts said the high open interest in spot May leaves the contract vulnerable to a sharp fall, but July is expected to hold support at 11.00 cents.</p>
<p>May's open interest stood at 21,223 lots as of early Monday.</p>
<p>In fundamental news, Thai raw sugar premiums were 10 cents per lb over CSCE May futures on an FOB basis, compared with nearly 20 cents last week, despite increased China offtake, trading sources said.</p>
<p>Dry warm weather has returned to Europe this week after light rain last weekend, forecasters said. The showers provided only scant relief to many of Europe's thirsty crops. Light rain is forecast for parts of Europe this weekend.</p>
<p>Tuesday, most-active CSCE July fell under key 11.00 cents early, but closed at 11.03 cents, down 0.04 cent. The back months settled unchanged to 0.04 lower.</p>
<p>The May/July spread narrowed to 0.29 from 0.42 on the previous close.</p>
<p>Tuesday's volume was estimated at 25,619 lots.</p>
<p>LIFFE white sugar futures were tightly mixed early Wednesday in anticipation of New York's May expiry. At 0845 EDT/1345 GMT, August stood 30 cents firmer at $312.50, while the back months were unchanged to 50 cents weaker.</p>
