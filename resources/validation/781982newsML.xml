<p>From the way U.S. Treasury market players were talking, Thursday could be a make it or break it day for the market.</p>
<p>&quot;If the bond auction goes well then the outlook is positive,&quot; said Richard Gilhooly, fixed income strategist at Paribas Corp. &quot;If we get a good final leg (of the Treasury's quarterly refunding, it is going to lead the market higher.&quot;</p>
<p>After two disappointing auctions on three- and 10-year notes, players were hoping for a successful $10 billion 30-year auction Thursday.  </p>
<p>After two auctions that failed to produce the hoped-for demand for issues cheapened up 20 basis points during Friday's selloff, the market was on edge going into the last leg.</p>
<p>Mike McClure, head trader at Zions First National Bank, said he was not optimistic since a lot of buying took place late Wednesday, as players used the cheaper levels as a buying opportunity.</p>
<p>&quot;We may get more of a concession; we may get back to 6.47, 6.48 percent,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>In late trading on Wednesday, the when-issued 30-year bond was yielding 6.45 percent. A yield that holds below 6.50 percent should boost the auction's prospects, McClure said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market needs a decent auction to correct off the bottom,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Others suggested the market could get a second chance even with less-than-enthusisastic demand given the buying that ensued after both the three- and 10-year note auctions.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is very well bid,&quot; Gilhooly said. &quot;People are bullish going into the bond auction. Investors want to go long.&quot;  </p>
<p>Until the 1300 EDT bidding deadline, activity is expected to be light. Not even the 0830 EDT release of jobless claims is expected to have much impact, unless far from expectations of a 20,000 rise.</p>
<p>Also on Thursday, wholesale inventories data for June are due at 1000 EDT and June consumer credit figures are slated for release at 1500 EDT, both of which are seen having little effect on the market.</p>
<p>Late on Wednesday, the outstanding 30-year bond was at 101-28/32, up 4/32, to yield 6.48 percent.</p>
