<p>The economy will expand moderately over the next year as inflation continues to hover in the current range of around 3 percent, according to a survey of top American business leaders released Thursday.</p>
<p>About 82 percent of members of the Business Council, which groups executives from 100 of the largest U.S. corporations, expect economic growth to plod along at a modest pace of between 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent over the next 12 months.</p>
<p>Some members expect a small pickup in wage costs, but only a small number thought inflation overall might head higher.</p>
<p>&quot;A sizable majority of the members (73 percent) think consumer inflation will be little changed during the next 12 months, while 27 percent anticipate an increase, and none expects a decrease,&quot; said the survey, released on the first day of a three-day semi-annual meeting of the council.</p>
<p>Turning to Federal Reserve policy, a substantial majority of the members, 89 percent, said the Fed should hold monetary policy steady.</p>
<p>The survey, which was taken before the Sept. 24 meeting in which the central bank decided not to raise interest rates, suggested that the members approved of the Fed decision.</p>
<p>The opinions of the executives regarding inflation and monetary policy differed from those of their technical consultants, who were also surveyed.</p>
<p>The consultants expressed concern about the potential for an acceleration in prices and, on average, saw scope for a rise in the current 5.25 percent federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for short term loans, of roughly a half-percentage point.</p>
<p>Still, speaking at a news conference, the Business Council executives stressed their sense that consumers remained unwilling to accept higher prices and said that was forcing firms to find ever-more creative ways to boost productivity and hold the line on costs.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't see the ability to increase prices in any of these areas,&quot; said Business Council Chairman Edgar Woolard Jr., referring to various sectors represented by the group.</p>
<p>Woolard, chairman of Du Pont Co., added, &quot;It's hard to see where inflation is even 3 percent.&quot;</p>
<p>Richard Rosenberg, former chairman of BankAmerica Corp., said members gave high marks to the Fed for its conduct of monetary policy.</p>
<p>&quot;It's pretty clear our membership was very enthusiastic about holding rates steady,&quot; Rosenberg said.</p>
<p>Regarding key policy issues, the executives listed cutting the budget deficit as a top priority followed by a reduction in capital gains taxes and the 15 percent across-the-board tax cut proposed by Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole.</p>
<p>Asked about their concerns regarding the upcoming presidential and congressional elections, some members said they worried that proposals for regulatory reforms sought by many businesses might languish if President Clinton is re-elected and one or more chambers of Congress is retaken by the Democrats.</p>
