<p>7th Level Inc said Friday it is in discussions with several companies concerning aspects of its new strategy focused on expanding its solutions and technology business.</p>
<p>The company said an immediate goal will be to generate additional capital needed for it to implement its new strategy. It plans to pursue this strategy with a variety of potential ventures and marketing partners.</p>
<p>The company said expanding its solutions and technology business will make it &quot;substantially&quot; less dependent on the &quot;volatile&quot; games market.</p>
<p>It also said it will continue to participate in the game industry with other publishers and producers.</p>
<p>The company said it had no releases in the second quarter, while it released one of its most successful titles, Monty Python &amp; the Quest for the Holy Grail, in 1996 second quarter.</p>
<p>The company said this accounted for its &quot;dramatic difference&quot; in revenues.</p>
<p>7th Level reported a loss of $0.52 per share compared with a loss per share of $0.49 for the same period a year ago. Revenues were $1.0 million versus $5.0 million.</p>
