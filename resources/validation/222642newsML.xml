<p>Economy Minister Roque Fernandez criticized Argentine banks and businesses Thursday for holding back recovery by being &quot;excessively conservative&quot; in making and taking on loans.</p>
<p>After painting a rosy picture of the monetary situation, the former Central Bank chief who took over from Domingo Cavallo in July said: &quot;However, credit for productive activity is coming back too slowly for my taste.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;Excessively conservative conduct on the demand and supply side of credit means the current credit level of almost 50 billion dollars and pesos is only eight percent more than in September 1995,&quot; Fernandez said in a speech.</p>
<p>Earlier in his address, the minister had underlined improvements in the monetary outlook since the Mexican tequila crisis that began in December 1994.</p>
<p>By mid-October this year, he said, currency and gold reserves stood at $16.6 billion, 0.4 percent above their December 1994 level and six percent higher than in March 1995.  </p>
<p>Bank deposits by mid-October were $51.1 billion, or 35 percent above the post-Tequila low in May 1995, reached after 18 percent of Argentine bank deposits fled the system.</p>
<p>&quot;But the most interesting thing is to compare with the pre-tequila era: the current $51.1 billion are 11 percent higher than December 1994's deposits,&quot; said Fernandez.</p>
<p>He confirmed his forecast of economic growth of &quot;no less than three percent&quot; this year and said Argentina has so far attracted $20 billion of foreign direct investments for the 1995-2000 period.</p>
<p>The biggest investments were in cars and autoparts, followed by food and drink and tobacco, petrochemicals, construction, entertainment, telecommunications, services, commerce, electronics, financial services, home appliances, pulp and paper and textiles, said Fernandez.</p>
