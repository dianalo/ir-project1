<headline>Avid stock jumps as Q1 tops expectations.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-24</dateline>

<p>Shares of Avid Technology Inc on Thursday jumped about 26 percent after the company's first-quarter earnings shattered Wall Street expectations.</p>
<p>Avid jumped four points to 19 in afternoon trading, with almost 2.4 million shares traded, five times its normal trading volume.  </p>
<p>Avid, which produces digital video and audio editing systems, posted first-quarter earnings of $0.08 a share, compared with a loss of $1.08 a share in the same period last year. Last year's first-quarter results included $20.2 million in pretax charges.</p>
<p>On a consensus basis, analysts expected Avid to post a loss of $0.09 a share, with estimates ranging from a loss of $0.07 a share to a loss of $0.17 a share, according to First Call.  </p>
<p>&quot;Their numbers were obviously better than expected. The gross margins were higher than expected, and the company controlled operating expenses better than expected,&quot; said Edgar Bierdeman, an analyst with Dakin Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;The second quarter could be better, as well, given the expense control we've seen,&quot; Bierdeman said.  </p>
<p>Avid's first-quarter gross margins were 48.1 percent, better than 46.3 percent analysts said they had expected.</p>
<p>Avid's strong first-quarter results added to the positive buzz about the Tewksbury, Mass.-based company.</p>
<p>Last month, Intel Corp said it would invest $14.75 million in Avid as part of a plan to bring Avid's high-quality video editing products to a wider audience.</p>
