<p>Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic, seen by the West as more moderate than her hardline colleagues, will visit Britain early next week, officials said on Monday.</p>
<p>They said Britain would try to support Plavsic in her struggle with intransigent colleagues in the Bosnian Serb leadership, who are dragging their feet on implementing the 1995 Dayton peace treaty which ended the war in Bosnia.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a sign we want to give her position in the Serb Republic a bit of a boost,&quot; one official said. Plavsic is due to meet Foreign Office Minister Tony Lloyd and other senior officials.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be the usual strong message about Dayton implementation,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>Earlier this month Plavsic reiterated her commitment to Dayton but refused to allow the extradition of war criminals, one of the treaty's cornerstones.</p>
<p>The Dayton accord was designed to heal enmities between Bosnia's Croats, Moslems and Serbs and rebuild the country. But there have been few signs of reconciliation and the three groups remain deeply suspicious of each other.</p>
<p>Western observers say other members of the Bosnian Serb leadership are trying to isolate Plavsic, who replaced indicted war criminal Radovan Karadzic when he was forced to step down last year.</p>
<p>In April she attacked other members of the leadership for trying to keep her quiet after she raised questions about war profiteering and criticising a cooperation pact with neighbouring Yugoslavia.</p>
