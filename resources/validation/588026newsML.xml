<p>---------------------------(May 15)-----------------------------</p>
<p>* NZ bonds bid across curve at Thursday's close  </p>
<p>* Short rates slightly weaker on soft TWI. Volumes good</p>
<p>* Mkt welcomes unemployment data, bond tender well supported</p>
<p>New Zealand debt ended Thursday's session reasonably well bid across the curve, although the short end weakened a fraction as the currency's Trade-Weighted Index slipped.</p>
<p>The 90-day bank bills tracked the TWI in late trade to end a basis point weaker at 7.03 percent.</p>
<p>By 0500 GMT the TWI was at 67.75, against its session low of 67.6 and its close on Wednesday of 67.83. The June futures contract also ended a point weaker, at 92.84.  </p>
<p>Demand was strong in the bonds, however, with a 0100 GMT tender of NZ$100 million of February 2001 bonds attracting a staggering $853 million in bids. The bonds were scooped up by a single bidder at 7.35 percent.</p>
<p>The 02/01 maturity, trading at 7.37 percent at the time of the tender, rallied two pips to 7.35 percent at the close.</p>
<p>&quot;It came in bid straight after the bids went in (2330 GMT), and then after that I think there might have been a wee bit of offshore profit taking, and the market tracked up before the tender results came out. We've just range-traded since then,&quot; one dealer said.  </p>
<p>He said it was possible there was some &quot;picture-painting&quot; in the tender, with the successful party padding out the bids to make it seem there was more support than was the case, but even so the genuine demand had been strong.</p>
<p>The dealer said he would not be surprised to see issuance of a Eurokiwi in the near future.</p>
<p>The market also welcomed news that the number of New Zealanders registered as unemployed rose to 157,841 in April, from 152,711 in March and against 143,582 a year ago.  </p>
<p>Dealers said that data added to the picture of a slowing economy, bolstering hopes that the central bank will see scope for an easing in monetary conditions when it releases its next monetary policy statement on June 27.</p>
<p>&quot;It's another nail in the coffin, if you like,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>The market is now awaiting March quarter retail trade data on Friday.</p>
