<p>Advance Bank Australia Ltd said it was unaware of any purchases of its shares by National Australia Bank Ltd and was confident about the outcome of the proposed merger with St George Bank Ltd.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not aware of any purchases by NAB,&quot; said an Advance Bank spokesman.</p>
<p>The Sydney Morning Herald reported on Thursday that Advance Bank strongly suspects that NAB has bought a stake of under five percent in order to agitate the A$2.65 billion takeover offer from St George at Advance's shareholder meeting on Monday.  </p>
<p>The Advance spokesman denied the Sydney Morning Herald report that Advance was paranoid and would spend a nerve-racking weekend before Monday's vote.</p>
<p>NAB has an eight percent stake in St George and has blocked attempts to expand, buying converting preference shares in Metway Bank Ltd earlier this year to block St George's unsuccessful bid for the Brisbane-based bank.</p>
<p>NAB has said its St George stake is strategic, but many banking analysts see the stake as a launch-pad for a potential takeover bid if the St George-Advance deal does not go ahead.</p>
