<p>Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong said on Wednesday they had issued a joint consultation paper on share offering mechanisms.</p>
<p>&quot;The SFC and the Stock Exchange consider that providing Hong Kong investors with access to new issues continues to be one of our priorities,&quot; Lawrence Fok, executive director of the listing division of the Stock Exchange, said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;Maintaining a proper balance between the shares available for investors under the public subscription and placing tranches is an important policy issue,&quot; Fok said.</p>
<p>The subscription tranche is intended for retail investors and the placing tranche is for institutional investors.</p>
<p>High levels of subscriptions by non-retail Hong Kong investors have reduced the proportion of shares that could be allocated to retail investors, the statement said.</p>
<p>Oversubscriptions of initial public offerings have caused imbalance in the supply and demand of funds in the local banking system, resulting in an increase of short-term interest rates on Hong Kong dollar, it added.</p>
<p>In the consultation paper, the SFC said comments were sought on eight areas including the minimum size for the public subscription tranche.</p>
<p>SFC and the Exchange recommended the initial size of the subscription tranche be set at a minimum 10 percent of the total issue, with a clawback provision allowing it to be increased to up to 30 percent of the total if the tranche is 15 times subscribed and to up to 50 percent if it is 50 times subscribed.</p>
<p>The paper recommended the Exchange be allowed to exercise its discretion not to allow any part of an issue to be offered in a placing, or to impose restrictions on it.</p>
<p>It also recommended that underwriters should have discretion on the allocation of shares in the placing tranche.</p>
<p>The consultation would also seek views on the eligibility to apply for shares in the subscription tranche and the placing tranche.</p>
<p>The statement said two approaches to deal with the problem had been indentified. The first was that all investors should be eligible to apply for shares either under the placing tranche or subscription tranche, but not both.</p>
<p>Under the second, the subscription tranche would be limited to retail investors who apply for shares worth HK$5 million or less, while the placing tranche would be limited to non-retail investors who apply for shares worth more than HK$5 million, it said.</p>
