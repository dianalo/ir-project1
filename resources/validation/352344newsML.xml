<p>The Athens bourse ended down 1.55 percent on Monday with fund managers saying it was a typical correction after profit taking. They expected the share index to fluctuate from 1,100 to 1,170 points in the next ten days.</p>
<p>&quot;The session on Monday was typical of profit taking. The general share index is likely to stay in the 1,100-1,170 range within the next ten days,&quot; said John Vezanis, a fund manager at Midland Mutual Funds.</p>
<p>Two sectors performed particularly well on Monday, construction and leasing shares.</p>
<p>Vezanis said that construction shares had been left behind and were expected to rise.</p>
<p>&quot;The Salonica metro is expected to begin by end-1997. Other big public projects, such as the Elefsis-Stavros highway, are also proceeding,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Leasing shares are cheap and have high dividend yields, he added.</p>
<p>Because they usually distribute dividends around this time of year they are considered to be seasonal and perform well this time around, he said.</p>
<p>The next shares to rise will be those of the food sector, as they have good prospects for 1997 and have been left behind, Vezanis said.</p>
<p>He expected bank shares, which were down on Monday after their recent rally, to rise again in 1997, he added.</p>
<p>Block trades in shares of Aegek, Michaniki, Intracom, Ergobank and Mailis boosted trading volume.</p>
<p>The Athens general share index closed 1.55 percent or 18.13 points down at 1148.06 from Friday's 1166.19, after opening at 1162.31.</p>
<p>Construction shares bucked the trend, climbing 6.23 percent, with leasing shares following with a strong rise of 5.57 percent. Banks lost 3.29 percent, after their recent rally.</p>
<p>Insurance ended 0.52 percent up while industrials lost 1.59 percent and investment shares lost 0.32 percent. Small caps ended 0.72 percent up.</p>
<p>Monday's turnover was 15.9 billion drachmas on volume of 6.8 million shares. Gainers led losers 135 to 87 with 18 issues unchanged on 240 traded.</p>
<p>The Merrill Lynch call spread warrant on OTE with a strike price of 3,800 drachmas was quoted lower at 842.00-860.00. Shares of OTE telecom the underlying, lost 45 drachmas to close at 5,135.</p>
<p>The recently launched ING Baring Financial Products American style call warrant based on a basket of six bank stocks was quoted lower at $19.95-$20.95. The strike price is set at $99.60 and the warrants expire October 8, 1997.</p>
<p>The Morgan Stanley Hellenic Blue Chip Warrant, which has a strike price of 100 marks, was quoted lower at 7,868-8,395 drachmas.</p>
