<p>Jim Furyk birdied the 18th hole on Thursday to grab a one shot lead in the suspended first round of the $1.8 million Byron Nelson Classic golf tournament.</p>
<p>Furyk's eighth birdie of the round allowed him to finish at 7-under-par 63, one shot better than three golfers, including Masters champion Tiger Woods.</p>
<p>Woods, playing for the first time since his victory at Augusta, was tied for second place with Dudley Hart and Paul Stankowski. Woods was looking for his third win of the year and Stankowski his second.</p>
<p>Play was delayed by lightning for three hours, 40 minutes, but all but three players completed their rounds before play was suspended.</p>
<p>Four straight birdies from holes seven through 10 highlighted Furyk's round. After a pair of six-foot putts on the seventh and eighth, he rolled in a 15-footer on the par-3 ninth hole to finish the front nine at 4-under 30.  He opened the back side with an eightfooter on the 10th hole.</p>
<p>&quot;I jumped right into the flow today,&quot; Furyk said.  &quot;It's nice to get off to a good start.&quot;</p>
<p>Furyk, playing the Cottonwood Valley Course, added back-to-back birdies on 12 and 13 before his only bogey of the round on the 14th. His other birdie of the round was at the second hole.</p>
<p>The bigger crowds were at the Tournament Players Course, where Woods started fast, with a birdie on the first hole before four straight birdies beginning at the fifth hole.  He carded a 30 on the front side.</p>
<p>&quot;I was just hoping for a round under par -- I was pretty nervous,&quot; he said. &quot;It was nice to feel the juices flowing. The front nine was more than I could have hoped for.&quot;</p>
<p>But after nailing a 30-footer for birdie on 10, Woods bogeyed 11 and 12 to fall back to 4-under.  He recovered with birdies on the 16th and 18th holes.</p>
<p>Stankowski, who beat Furyk in a playoff to win the Hawaiian Open in February, matched Woods at the Tournament Course, birdying the first two holes and five of the first nine. He added a pair of birdies and a bogey on the back side.</p>
<p>Tom Watson, the last Tour player to win the same event three straight years when he won here from 1978-80, was among a group of six golfers at 5-under 65.</p>
<p>Ten golfers are three shots back with 66s, including defending champion Phil Mickelson, Nick Faldo and Ben Crenshaw.</p>
