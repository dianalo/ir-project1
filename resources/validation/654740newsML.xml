<title>UK: Israel will never be a ghetto-Netanyahu.</title>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday warned Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat that Israel would never reduce itself to &quot;a ghetto state on the shores of the Mediterranean&quot;.</p>
<p>In an interview to mark his first year in office, Netanyahu also vowed to continue disputed construction of the Har Homa settlement, on occupied land in East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Arafat must tell his people openly and squarely that peace will not be achieved on the 1967 (border) lines,&quot; he told the London Times.</p>
<p>&quot;Israel will not reduce itself to a fragile ghetto state on the Mediterranean shores.</p>
<p>&quot;Equally Mr Arafat must stop promising the division of Jerusalem because no one in Israel, or throughout the Jewish people, will permit the rebuilding of a Berlin Wall inside Israel's capital.</p>
<p>&quot;These are the important adjustments to reality that have yet to take place on the Palestinian side. When they do take place, I believe peace will be in reach.&quot;</p>
<p>He defended construction of the Har Homa settlement, Jabal Abu Ghneim in Arabic, which has virtually brought the peace process to a standstill.</p>
<p>&quot;The whole idea that the construction of houses, homes and schools is a barrier to peace is absurd,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>On the economic front, Netanyahu claimed to be changing the face of Israel with a major privatisation programme.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we have made big strides into my vision of Israel as a liberalised, free economy which is rapidly becoming one of the great centres of information and high technology economy anywhere in the world,&quot; he said.</p>
