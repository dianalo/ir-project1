<p>Waste Management NZ Ltd should be almost debt free by the end of 1997, Chief Executive Kim Ellis said in an interview.</p>
<p>Commenting on Waste Management's strong balance sheet, Ellis said: &quot;We are getting caught up with EVA (economic value added) at the moment and we will be almost debt-free by the end of next year at the rate we are going, which just does not work on an EVA model.&quot;  </p>
<p>Waste Management NZ is 60 percent owned by Waste Management International Plc (WMI), which in turn is 80 percent owned by WMX Technologies Inc in the United States.</p>
<p>Ellis said it did not appear likely that WMI's level of ownership would change.</p>
<p>While remaining listed in New Zealand did have its costs, there were benefits in terms of being able to attract a higher standard of management and a higher profile generally.</p>
<p>It also enabled a degree of independence from the parent.</p>
<p>But Ellis agreed that, with such a high proportion of the stock tied up by WMI, illiquidity was a problem.  </p>
<p>This had been partly addressed by a recent two-for-one bonus issue and a sell-down by one of the company's major individual shareholders.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a lot more liquidity now in terms of spread of institutional interest than there was two years ago, but it's still not as liquid as it could be,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The directors are more aware of this issue and have a little more confidence about dealing with it. So that's another component of strategy that has to be considered. We should be carrying some debt.&quot;  </p>
<p>Ellis said some form of capital repayment was an option &quot;or spending a lot of money somewhere&quot;.</p>
<p>While Redvale landfill in Auckland had taken up NZ$40 million and more than four years to develop, the company was still cash positive at the end of every year.</p>
<p>Waste Management was enjoying a &quot;modestly good year&quot; along similar lines to the first half to June, when it made a NZ$3.27 million profit, up nine percent on the same period a year ago.</p>
