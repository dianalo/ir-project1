<p>Norway's attacking Vikings have won the first two men's races of the Alpine skiing world championships and questions are being asked.</p>
<p>Such as how do they do it and what exactly do they have that the other nations do not.</p>
<p>The answer appears to be a mixture of fortune, experiment -- and three very good skiers.</p>
<p>Atle Skaardal, 30-year-old winner of Monday's super-G, took the title last year as well and says he is not doing anything different this season.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm too old to learn new things,&quot; said Skaardal, whose two second places in downhill World Cup races make him a medal candidate in Saturday's blue ribbon event as well.</p>
<p>Lasse Kjus, who came second in the super-G and led the combined event until a poor slalom second leg gave victory to compatriot Kjetil-Andre Aamodt, believed in luck.</p>
<p>&quot;We are just that little bit older and maybe more experienced,&quot; he said on Friday. &quot;You need a lot of luck to win races. Maybe we have been a bit lucky up until now.&quot;</p>
<p>Aamodt said nothing had changed. &quot;We were good last year too,&quot; he said, although Norway have as many medals in two events as the men won in the entire 1996 championships.</p>
<p>In 1993 they won three golds and two silvers from four races, a tally they could well equal here, and again it was Aamodt, Kjus and Skaardal who did it.</p>
<p>However, luck aside, a new German coach brought in at the start of the season has also helped matters.</p>
<p>Martin Osswald worked formerly with Germany's world and Olympic giant slalom champion Markus Wasmeier and the German women juniors before the 1994 Olympics.</p>
<p>Jan Jensen, the president of the Norwegian Alpine skiing federation, said Osswald's arrival had been a great success and had brought a fresh approach to a coaching programme in danger of becoming stale.</p>
<p>&quot;We are very satisfied with him. It has been very successful, he has brought new qualities into the Norwegian team,&quot; said Jensen. &quot;At this level it is always a question of new creative ways of thinking. Every new way is positive.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In the last four years we had followed the same lines but we have changed it according to his advice.&quot;</p>
<p>Audun Groenvold, a former ski jumper in his debut championships, said Osswald had a lot of experience and was making an impact more on the mental side.</p>
<p>&quot;At this level the coach doesn't say so much, he isn't guiding us so much and we have to work a lot on our own. But he gives us small hints all the time,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>This season the Norwegians made a solid if unspectacular start with Aamodt finishing third in the first two races -- a giant slalom in Soelden and a slalom in Park City.</p>
<p>The first victory came in a slalom on December 1 when Tom Stiansen had his first World Cup win in Breckenridge.</p>
<p>Aamodt, who has had six podium finishes in total and leads the overall World Cup, won a giant slalom in Adelboden while Kjus, last year's World Cup champion, won a combined in Kitzbuehel to seal his comeback from illness.</p>
<p>Aamodt's combined win on Thursday night took his career medal tally to 11 and the 25-year-old admitted he had his sights on Marc Girardelli's record of 13.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, for sure it can be a goal for me. I have 11 medals now, two more to go. That'll be fun,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Norwegian women's team are far less successful  with the promising racers of last season currently in disappointing form and without a podium finish.</p>
<p>Norway have never had a women's world or Olympic champion and 1993 world silver and bronze medallist Astrid Loedemel, who appeared to be the saviour some years ago, is injured.</p>
