<p>1860 Munich, playing with 10 men from the 57th minute, held big-spending local rivals Bayern Munich to an eventful 1-1 draw in front of 68,000 fans in the Olympic Stadium on Friday.</p>
<p>The draw was enough to give Bayern a one-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga but their triumph could be shortlived as second-placed VfB Stuttgart take on lowly St Pauli on Saturday.</p>
<p>Bayern looked set for victory after 1860's Jens Jeremies, who had already been booked, was sent off for hand ball.</p>
<p>Their best chance came in the 79th minute when 1860's Pele was adjudged to have brought down Thomas Strunz in the box, but captain Lothar Matthaeus shot weakly from the spot and Bernd Maier made a comfortable save.</p>
<p>Germany defender Markus Babbel gave Bayern the lead from close range in the 34th minute but a header from Polish midfield maestro Piotr Nowak put 1860 back on level terms 10 minutes after the break.</p>
<p>Off the pitch, two of Bavaria's most prominent politicians swapped the corridors of power for the commentary box.</p>
<p>Bayern fan and state premier Edmund Stoiber and German Finance Minister Theo Waigel, a committed 1860 supporter, described the game for radio listeners.</p>
