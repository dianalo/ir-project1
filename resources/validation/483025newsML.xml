<p>Austria's ATX index sank 0.59 percent on Wednesday, with many investors still shaken by sharp falls in the United States and Europe at the start of the week, and traders saw no early end to the decline.</p>
<p>The blue-chip ATX closed 6.93 points down at 1,176.56 after trading in a 1,172.45 to 1,89.03 points range. Overall 16 issues were lower, three higher and two unchanged.</p>
<p>&quot;Unless foreign markets provide us with a positive impulse I see prices sinking towards 1,150,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>April ATX futures slipped seven points to 1.170 on turnover of 2,157 contracts.</p>
<p>In continuous trade, water treatment company BWT bucked the weak trend jumping 8.28 percent to close at a new high for the year of 1,570 schillings.</p>
<p>BWT shares have been on a bull run since last month when the firm announced it was developing a new water-treatment technology that would bring in 700 million schillings in extra sales in the year 2001.</p>
<p>&quot;There's one big buyer -- a domestic bank -- but I can't say who it's on behalf of,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>Among ATX shares, beverage group BBAG, which dismissed takeover rumours on Tuesday, was the leading decliner. Its shares fell 3.1 percent to 720 schillings.</p>
<p>Mayr-Melnhof, which earlier released positive 1996 earnings and said it was reinstating a dividend, closed four schillings down at 603. Traders said the results contained no surprises.</p>
<p>The all-share Vienna bourse index slipped 1.65 points to 446.8.</p>
