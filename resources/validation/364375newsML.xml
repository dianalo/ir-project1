<p>The European Commission is preparing a decision on how Kesko should restore competition on the Finnish daily goods market after the EU executive blocked the company's merger with rival wholesaler and retailer Tuko.</p>
<p>EU sources said on Friday an announcement was expected soon, perhaps later this month, after the issue was discussed this week by the bloc's advisory committee on competition, made up of experts from the member states.</p>
<p>One source speculated that Kesko may keep parts of Tuko. &quot;But it must not be parts which noticeably strengthen Kesko's position on the Finnish market,&quot; the source said.</p>
<p>Kesko acquired Tuko in May last year, but the Commission blocked the merger half a year later, saying it would damage competition on the Finnish daily consumer goods market.</p>
<p>Another EU source noted that the Commission in November had referred only to the situation in the daily consumer goods market. &quot;And Tuko is in itself active on other markets as well,&quot; he said, mentioning specialty goods and hardware stores.</p>
<p>But he and other EU officials refused to give details.</p>
<p>Last month, Kesko chief executive officer Eero Kinnunen said he expected the Commission to announce in February at the latest which parts of Tuko it must sell. He said there had been both domestic and foreign interest in Tuko.</p>
<p>When it blocked the merger, the Commission said that Kesko/Tuko would have taken more than 55 percent of the Finnish retail market. Kesko has appealed to the European court.</p>
<p>The Commission said at the time that the merger &quot;creates a dominant position which significantly impedes effective competition on the retail and cash and carry markets for daily consumer goods in Finland.&quot;</p>
<p>The Commission vets corporate deals to see whether they could harm competition in the 15-nation EU. Many deals have been approved only after changes were made.</p>
<p>Investigation of the Kesko deal, which was announced in May, was handed over by the Finnish Office of Free Competition as Finland does not have its own merger regulation.</p>
<p>The deal would have made Kesko, which reported 1995 annual group sales of 26.5 billion markka ($5.36 billion), into Finland's third largest company in terms of net sales. Tuko's annual group sales are around 11.4 billion markka.</p>
<p>($1 = 4.94 markka)</p>
