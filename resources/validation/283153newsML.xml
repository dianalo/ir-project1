<p>Sri Lankan forces killed at least 19 guerrillas and smashed a Tamil rebel base on Wednesday, the second day of an offensive to clear separatist bases in the country's east, military officials said.</p>
<p>Forces, backed by aircraft and artillery, overran a camp of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) at Rukam, a remote village southwest of Batticaloa town, 240 km (150 miles) east of Colombo, military officials in the area told Reuters.</p>
<p>At least 14 rebels who were in the camp were killed in the afternoon attack by the military, who launched &quot;Operation Rivijaya&quot; in the early hours of Tuesday to clear parts of the east from rebel domination, the military officials said.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, troops confronted and killed another five rebels a few miles (km) south of Rukam, they added.</p>
<p>Rukam is along the Maha Oya-Chenkaladi highway, a supply route for the military, which connects the coastal town of Batticaloa to the island's interior.</p>
<p>The LTTE are fighting for an independent homeland for minority Tamils in this Indian Ocean island's north and east. Officials from the group were not immediately available for comment on reports of the latest attack.</p>
<p>Military officials in Colombo said the operation was a limited one and was launched after intelligence reports of a rebel build-up in the area.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, a Tiger suicide bomber killed one of eastern Sri Lanka's senior police officers in Batticaloa. The bomber rammed a motorcycle into the jeep of the deputy chief of the police Special Task Force (STF) near Karativu, south of Batticaloa.</p>
<p>The week before, the Tigers overran an STF camp at Pulukunava in Amparai district, adjoining Batticaloa, killing 36 security personnel. It was the Tigers' biggest attack on government forces in more than two months.</p>
<p>The government says more than 50,000 people have died in the war, now in its 14th year. The LTTE says the toll is much higher.</p>
