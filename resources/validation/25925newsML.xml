<p>Christian militants set off five explosions in a southern Philippine town in protest against Manila's peace deal with Moslem rebels, police said on Saturday.</p>
<p>No casualties or damage was reported in the blasts which occurred before dawn on Friday in the main square of Dumingag town in Zamboanga del Sur province, a centre of Christian resistance to the accord.</p>
<p>Police said the blasts were caused by home-made bombs but a report from an army unit stationed in Dumingag said the explosions came from big firecrackers.</p>
<p>The militants, calling themselves the Mindanao Christian Unified Command (MCUC), left behind leaflets warning of bloodshed if President Fidel Ramos went ahead with the accord with the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF).</p>
<p>The accord calls for the setting up of a Southern Philippine Council for Peace and Development (SPCPD) led by MNLF chief Nur Misuari to supervise development of 14 southern provinces in the Mindanao region.</p>
<p>The council will be followed by a plebiscite and regional autonomy three years later.</p>
<p>&quot;Ramos and Misuari, don't force the SPCPD on us so that there will be no bloodshed in Mindanao,&quot; said one leaflet .</p>
<p>The explosions occurred the day government and MNLF panels initialled the peace agreement in Jakarta, Indonesia, on Friday. A formal signing of the accord is to be held in Manila on Monday.</p>
<p>Christian residents of Mindanao have opposed the accord, accusing Ramos of a sell-out, and threatened to form vigilante groups to fight the deal.</p>
<p>The Philippines' five million Moslems regard Mindanao as their ancestral homeland although they are now outnumbered three-to-one by Christian settlers in the region.</p>
