<title>HUNGARY: Hungary's BUX rallies to new record close.</title>
<headline>Hungary's BUX rallies to new record close.</headline>
<dateline>BUDAPEST 1997-07-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Hungarian share market rallied to new record levels on Wednesday, bolstered by fresh demand and a strong dollar, traders said.</p>
<p>The BUX index finished at a preliminary 6,870.57 points, up 116.62 points or 1.73 percent. BUX futures were also trading firmer.</p>
<p>&quot;Foreigners already appeared on Tuesday with strong demand at lower prices,&quot; said Kalman Schuszter of New York Broker Budapest. &quot;At the same time one should not forget that the dollar has strengthened substantially.&quot;</p>
<p>A strong dollar makes the forint, thus Hungarian shares cheaper for foreigners.</p>
<p>Currently the forint trades at 188.11/16 to the dollar, compared to 187.70/75 at opening.</p>
<p>An analyst told Reuters earlier today that fresh capital was flowing in the Hungarian market.</p>
<p>&quot;I think there are probably people taking some profit but at the same time there's much more money coming in,&quot; Tommy Erdei, analyst at ABN-AMRO Hoare Govett in Budapest, told Reuters earlier today. He added, however, that he expected some slowdown to come in the coming month.</p>
<p>On Wednesday several stocks hit new record levels before closing a little lower.</p>
<p>Among them was OTP Bank for which an increasing number of foreign funds show demand, Schuszter said. OTP finished at 5,150 forints, up 200, but below an all-time high of 5,220 forints reached during the session.</p>
<p>Hotel firm Danubius benefited from its announcement this morning according to which the privatisation agency APV Rt transferred 1.407 billion forints to it under the 1989 privatisation law.</p>
<p>&quot;This 1.4 billion forint is at least as important as a five billion payout for TVK,&quot; Schuszter said.</p>
<p>APV said in late June it was to pay 4.40 billion forints of of privatisation revenue and an additional 842 million of accumulated interest to TVK until June 30.</p>
<p>TVK finished at 3,385 forints, up 85.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the market, garment factory Styl was suspended after a 20.83 percent rally to 1,450 forints.</p>
<p>Heavyweight oil firm MOL closed at 4,185 forints, up 85, in moderate turnover.</p>
