<title>USA: White House disputes &quot;misleading&quot; database figures.</title>

<p>The chairman of a congressional panel investigating the White House database said on Friday that it was bigger than had been acknowledged, but the White House disputed his figures.</p>
<p>Rep David McIntosh, R-Indiana, said a review of 2,000 documents turned over by the White House on Thursday showed that the White House &quot;has not honestly characterised&quot; the size of the database.</p>
<p>He said White House Counsel Jack Quinn had written that the database had cost the taxpayers $545,000 -- but the documents showed cost estimates at more than $1.7 million.</p>
<p>McIntosh also said the documents showed that in April there were 300,000 individuals and 50,000 organisations stored in the database, although the White House had said it contained the names of 200,000 individuals.</p>
<p>McIntosh also said the subcommittee had been &quot;misled&quot; by a list showing fewer than 150 past and present White House staffers had access to the database because the documents showed more than 200 people had access.</p>
<p>A White House spokesman, Barry Toiv, said the White House's best estimate of the number of names remained 200,000, noting that there were &quot;an extraordinary number&quot; of duplications.</p>
<p>He said the documents showing more people with access to the database were inaccurate and the White House had given as precise an estimate as possible of costs, based on the cost of outside contractors, hardware and software. He said the subcommittee had included salaries and benefits of White House staff who had done any work on the database.</p>
<p>&quot;These people would have been working there anyway,&quot; Toiv said. &quot;All they (the subcommittee) had to do was get on the phone and ask what these documents meant,&quot; he said. &quot;Instead they put out a press release.&quot;</p>
