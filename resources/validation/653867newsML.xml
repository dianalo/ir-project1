<headline>Nepal's foreign minister resigns.</headline>

<p>Nepal's Foreign Minister Prakash Chandra Lohani said on Wednesday he had resigned from his post in protest against what he described as &quot;widespread rigging and intimidation&quot; by the country's main communist party in recent local elections.  </p>
<p>Lohani belongs to Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand's Rashtriya Prajatantra Party (RPP).</p>
<p>The voting on May 17 and 26 for nearly 190,000 representatives in 4,000 village committees and 58 municipalities was marred by violence in which at least six people died.</p>
<p>The dominant member in the ruling three-party coalition, the communist United Marxist-Leninist (UML) party, had won more than 34,000 places against the RPP's 9,000 seats in the first round of voting. Officials have ordered re-polls in 437 places affected by violence, and full results are expected this week.</p>
<p>&quot;This campaign of intimidation, threats and strong-arm tactics of the UML sustained by the help of the administration, found the RPP a silent spectator, helpless and without any defence,&quot; Lohani said in a statement.</p>
