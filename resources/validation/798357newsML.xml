<p>While play started shortly after dawn on Thursday, the PGA Championship really began some two hours later when the dream trio of Tiger Woods, Ernie Els and Justin Leonard teed off before big crowds at Winged Foot Golf Club.</p>
<p>The three &quot;Twentysomethings&quot; -- the young Masters, U.S. Open and British Opens champions, respectively -- were the most attractive group in the field of 150 professionals.</p>
<p>Leonard, 25, immediately fell behind in the unofficial match among golf's next generation of stars when he bogeyed the 446-yard first hole while Woods, 21, and South African Els, 27, opened with pars.</p>
<p>The sun was shining when the first players began teeing off on Winged Foot's 6,987-yard, par-70 West Course, which received intermittent rain through most of Wednesday</p>
<p>While the slightly soft conditions made Winged Foot's notoriously hard greens play a little easier for the first players off, no one made an early assault on par.</p>
<p>Phil Mickelson, 27, another of the up-and-coming under-30 stars, went out in one under par -- as did Ignacio Garrido of Spain, who is expected to be on Europe's Ryder Cup team in September, and American Doug Martin, both playing in the second group of the day.</p>
<p>However, not everyone found Winged Foot easy. The two Britons playing with Mickelson -- Nick Faldo and Darren Clarke - - both made the turn at four over par, after each made four bogeys.</p>
<p>Per-Ulrik Johansson of Sweden, another potential Ryder Cup player, and American Bob Tway, the 1986 PGA champion, were at two under par after eight holes.</p>
