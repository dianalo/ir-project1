<p>Italian debt markets ended nearly 50 basis points down on the day but recovered from the depth of the session's lows before dealers packed up for the weekend.</p>
<p>Traders said the BTP market had held up relatively well although some expected further correction when traders returned on Monday, given the sharp rally of the market in recent weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody's waiting for a sell-off. A bit came this morning. But something is changing on BTPs in that we're waiting for a correction,&quot; one broker at a major UK bank in London said.</p>
<p>The March LIFFE future was 45 basis points down at 131.55 after touching 131.34 support.  </p>
<p>The broker said he was expecting the BTP future to try trading lower at the start of next week, with a test down to 131.00 or a little below that level.</p>
<p>However it had been bought back well at 131.34 even though traders said volumes were pretty subdued for the day.</p>
<p>The July 2006 Btp ended 46 basis points down at 110.64 and was yielding 7.31 percent with a spread of 152 basis points over the 10-year benchmark Bund.</p>
<p>Another broker at a large U.S. bank in London said there was still plenty of foreign interest in Btps even though volume was not as substantial as that in early January.  </p>
<p>Longer term, the broker said, investors expected the spread over Germany to close in further.</p>
<p>On the political front, the market was still waiting to see whether metal workers' unions and their employers would ever reach an accord over renewing contracts.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Romano Prodi met three main union confederation leaders earlier on Friday and the government has called union and industry chiefs to a meeting on Monday.</p>
<p>Traders say the market will watch whether Prodi can bring about a deal, regarding it as a test of his strength as a leader. --Charlotte Cooper, Milan bureau +39 2 6612507</p>
