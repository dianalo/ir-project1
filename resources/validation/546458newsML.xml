<p>Share prices in Hungarian pharmaceuticals company Richter Gedeon Rt surged to record levels on Tuesday following the release of its first quarter earnings.</p>
<p>&quot;The surge in Richter shares was clearly the result of the earnings report,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Richter soared to a yet uncharted 13,800 forints on Tuesday, benefiting from the January-March earnings. Richter closed at 13,650 forints, up 950 from Monday's close.</p>
<p>Richter released its IAS Q1 results in the official gazette of the Budapest Stock Exchange this morning.</p>
<p>The company reported its operating profits surging to 4.322 billion forints on sales of 12.801 billion in the first three months of 1997, up from an operating profit of 2.696 billion forints on sales of 9.419 billion in the same period of 1996.</p>
<p>Analysts said the company's first quarter was impressive.</p>
<p>&quot;Its first quarter was extremely strong,&quot; said Gabor Sitanyi, analyst at ING Barings in London.</p>
<p>&quot;It performed amazingly on the Russian markets, its sales to CIS countries grew by 40 percent in dollar terms,&quot; he said, adding this was beyond expectations.</p>
<p>Of Richter's total sales, exports accounted for 8.272 billion forints, maintaining the roughly two-third proportion of exports within total sales.</p>
<p>Richter's quarterly exports to the CIS countries surged to 3.905 billion forints from 2.284 billion.</p>
<p>Richter reported rising margins and attributed this to the dollar's strength.</p>
<p>&quot;Gross profit margins increased to 64.2 percent (in January-March 1997) from 62 percent in the corresponding period of the prior year, reflecting the favourable impact of a considerably stronger US dollar, and a change in the sales mix,&quot; Richter said in the bourse gazette.</p>
<p>&quot;Operating margins for the first quarter of 1997 were 33.8 percent compared with 28.6 percents in the corresponding period of 1996,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>Analysts said that the continued shift to sales of finished products at the expense of bulk products on markets other than the Hungarian, CIS and central European markets, was beneficial as it generates higher gross margins.</p>
<p>Sitanyi said Richter was expected to continue to benefit from its distribution network in Russia, from its own production facility there -- which is expected to go operational this year -- and from its established presence in Ukraine and Vietnam.</p>
<p>&quot;What investors like in the company is that they are ahead of the rivals in marketing,&quot; Sitanyi said. &quot;Richter's marketing and distribution... is probably the strongest in the region.&quot;</p>
