<title>USA: Amoco buying gasoline at U.S. Gulf - traders.</title>
<headline>Amoco buying gasoline at U.S. Gulf - traders.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-10-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>Amoco Corp was buying gasolne heavily Monday morning in U.S. Gulf Coast spot gasoline markets amid talk the company was having problems at its huge Texas City, Texas refinery, gasoline traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;There must be some problem at Amoco. He's been buying gasoline &quot;heavily&quot; for the better part of a week,&quot; said one Gulf Coast trader.</p>
<p>Company officials were not immediately available to comment on whether the 433,000 barrel per day (bpd) Texas City refinery was having any problems with its 204,000 bpd catalytic cracking and 80,000 bpd reforming capacities.  </p>
<p>Traders said Amoco's traders had bought as much as 300,000 bpd of gasoline Monday morning, in addition to similar volumes on Friday and Thursday.</p>
<p>Prices in Gulf Coast spot markets were quickly climbing in value on the talk, with prompt barrels of regular conventional heard done at 0.25 cent over November NYMEX gasoline futures -- or for about 71.30 cents a gallon.</p>
<p>Between one cent moves on the NYMEX and in cash markets, that means gasoline is 2.00 cents more expensive than when trading began on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;Gasoline's going off like a rocket again,&quot; a trader said.  </p>
<p>Whether Amoco was having problems at the huge Texas City plant could not be immediately verified, but environmental regulators in Texas said they did not have any indications there were problems.</p>
<p>Regulators are typically contacted when a unit puts off extraordinary emissions -- an occurance that sometimes coincides with pulling a refinery unit off line.</p>
