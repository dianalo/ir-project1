<p>Republican vice presidential candidate Jack Kemp said on Saturday he and Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole would if elected seek to abolish the capital-gains tax and the estate tax.</p>
<p>&quot;Bob Dole and Jack Kemp believe that when we fundamentally overhaul the tax code of America by 1998 or '99 at the latest ... there will be no capital-gains tax at all and no estate tax at all,&quot; Kemp told a meeting of the National Association of Manufacturers in answer to an audience question.</p>
<p>&quot;They're dumb taxes. Dumb. Dumb,&quot; Kemp said to applause from the business group.</p>
<p>The Dole campaign until now has talked of cutting the capital-gains tax by 50 percent as part of a six-year, $548 billion package worth of tax cuts.</p>
<p>Dole also has proposed as a part of that package to give Americans a 15 percent across-the-board income-tax cut and a $500 a child tax tax credit, while balancing the budget.</p>
<p>In addition, Dole has vowed to repeal the current tax code and replace it with a &quot;lower, flatter, fairer&quot; system. And the Kansas Republican wants to end the Internal Revenue Service &quot;as we know it.&quot;</p>
<p>President Bill Clinton and other critics have questioned how Dole can cut taxes sharply and still eliminate the budget gap.</p>
<p>&quot;Jack Kemp and I have a vision of growth, opportunity, and strong families through lower taxes ... a vision of smaller government and greater responsibility entrusted to the people, families, and communities across America,&quot; Dole said in his weekly radio address on Saturday.</p>
