<p>Congo, which has received hundreds of Tutsis fleeing conflict in neighbouring Zaire, has set up a committee to deal with a possible refugee problem from the crisis, an official said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>National Red Cross president Victorine Ida Nze told reporters the move followed the influx of Tutsis from the Zaire capital Kinshasa.</p>
<p>More than 1,000 Tutsis are estimated to have left Kinshasa since an ethnic-Tutsi rebellion broke out in eastern Zaire two weeks ago overwhelming the Zaire army there.</p>
<p>Hundreds of Tutsis hounded in anger in Zaire are believed to be in hiding, hoping to flee at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p>Nze said 207 arrived in Brazzaville on Tuesday in canoes plying the River Congo which runs between the two capitals and spent the night in Red Cross tents.</p>
<p>The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said it had brought in tents, blankets, food and telecommunication equipment and was ready to provide help for up to 3,500 refugees for a period of six months.</p>
<p>The Federation said a joint emergency unit with the local Red Cross was set up a week ago and had registred 835 refugees.</p>
<p>A plane expected from Rwanda to take home about 100 refugees failed to turn up in Brazzaville on Tuesday and officials said it would probably arrive on Thursday.</p>
<p>Some Tutsis said they paid up to $3,000 a head to cross in dugout canoes. About 400 crossed in such fashion on Monday.</p>
