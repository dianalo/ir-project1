<headline>Yeltsin congratulates Armenian leader on victory.</headline>

<p>Boris Yeltsin has written to Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan, congratulating him on his re-election and criticising opposition supporters who took to the streets of Yerevan in protest at alleged vote-rigging.</p>
<p>Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mikhail Demurin told a regular news briefing on Thursday: &quot;President...Yeltsin has sent Levon Ter-Petrosyan a congratulatory telegram, in which in particular he says the election results convincingly confirmed the Armenian people are looking to the future with optimism.&quot;</p>
<p>Yeltsin is in a Moscow clinic awaiting heart bypass surgery in six to eight weeks.</p>
<p>Echoing the terms in which he characterised his own reelection in July, Yeltsin told Ter-Petrosyan the Armenian people had supported &quot;the continuation of reform in the name of freedom, democracy and prosperity&quot;.</p>
<p>Ter-Petrosyan, a 50-year-old academic, has ruled Armenia for five years, since it became independent on the collapse of the Soviet Union. Despite grinding economic problems, he was reelected with 52 percent of the vote on Sunday against 41 percent for his former prime minister Vazgen Manukyan.</p>
<p>Parliament voted overwhelmingly on Thursday to remove the parliamenatary immunity of Manukyan and seven of his supporters, who were arrested after thousands of opposition demonstrators, alleging vote-rigging, clashed with police on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>Demurin said Moscow deplored the opposition violence.</p>
<p>&quot;Having failed to achieve success by democratic means, the opposition has decided to resort to force,&quot; the spokesman said. &quot;The Russian foreign ministry cannot but decisively condemn the aggressive actions of the opposition.&quot;</p>
<p>But some Russian politicians took a different view.</p>
<p>&quot;We are very pleased with the events in Armenia, given that Levon Ter-Petrosyan's main opponent won the election,&quot; said nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, accusing Ter-Petrosyan of fixing the vote in the same way, he alleged, as Yeltsin himself.</p>
<p>&quot;Our little brothers are copying Moscow,&quot; Zhirinovsky told Ekho Moskvy radio. But unlike Russia's defeated communists, the Armenian opposition was ready to fight &quot;dictatorship&quot;, he said.</p>
<p>International observers called Russia's presidential election in June and July, in which Zhirinovsky came fifth, free and fair. In Armenia, observers said there were many violations but stopped short of calling the poll unfair.</p>
