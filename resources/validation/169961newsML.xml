<p>Top European Union and Swiss officials said on Wednesday they hoped to wind up tricky negotiations on transport and free movement of people in the coming months.</p>
<p>They indicated the aim was to conclude an overall bilateral economic package which would define relations between Switzerland -- where popular resistance to joining the EU remains strong -- and the 15-member bloc by next spring.</p>
<p>Jacques Santer, president of the European Commission, and current Swiss President Jean-Pascal Delamuraz told a news conference after talks in Lausanne that negotiations would resume among technical experts in Brussels on Thursday.</p>
<p>Talks between the Swiss government and Brussels which began early last year have focussed on six main questions, on all of which apart from transport and personal movement basic agreement has been reached.</p>
<p>&quot;It is our intention to get an accord with the Swiss government on the six issues....We are on the last lap for a final accord,&quot; Santer said. He said this might be possible in December but would probably have to wait till early 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;There are just a few things left, but such things are sometimes essential,&quot; said Delamuraz, making clear he was referring to the terms under which EU nations could take up jobs in Switzerland.</p>
<p>Delamuraz said the main difference was over total abolition of quotas that Switzerland has wanted to maintain in its legal arsenal as a safety mechanism in case of a large influx of EU workers seeking high-wage Swiss jobs.</p>
<p>The Swiss president said: &quot;We are getting closer and I am hopeful, but negotiations have to be completed in detail to find our common ground.&quot;</p>
<p>Apart from transport, which includes civil aviation, and free movement of people the other four issues in the negotiations are agriculture, technical barriers to trade, government procurement and research and development.</p>
<p>The Swiss coalition government, which includes mainstream parties from right to left, favours joining the EU eventually but resistance persists among traditional-minded people, especially in the German-speaking part of the country.</p>
<p>In a referendum in 1992, Swiss voters rejected although by a narrow margin a proposal to join the European Economic Area which links the then seven-nation European Free Trade Association (EFTA) with the then European Community.</p>
<p>Since then, three of Switzerland's EFTA partners -- Finland, Sweden and its eastern neighbour Austria -- have switched to the EU, leaving it in a rump EFTA with Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, all three of which also belong to the EEA.</p>
<p>It was the refusal of the Swiss voters, many of whom said they feared loss of sovereignty and undermining of the country's political neutrality, to approve EEA membership that made the separate negotiations with Brussels necessary.</p>
