<p>European Union finance ministers and central bank governors will try to nudge a dream of economic integration and a common currency one step closer to reality at informal talks in Dublin on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;Not just talks, but results,&quot; the head of the powerful German Bundesbank, Hans Tietmeyer, told reporters who asked what the one-day informal meeting would yield.</p>
<p>Germany and France, the two countries viewed as essential founder members of European Economic and Monetary Union, have come to Dublin determined to inject new life into the project to create a single &quot;Euro&quot; currency.</p>
<p>The two heavyweights, fresh from presenting budget packages aimed at bringing their budget deficits under control to meet the entry conditions for EMU laid down in the Maastricht Treaty, are expected to urge others to do the same.</p>
<p>They have also agreed a joint position on all the main agenda points for the meeting, aimed at giving the planned single currency a secure basis long-term.</p>
<p>But while most countries back their general proposals the discussion of details is likely to be far from easy. France's budget is seen by some critics as an attempt to manipulate its accounts to stretch the Maastricht entry terms.</p>
<p>Top of the agenda is the creation of a so-called stability pact to ensure budget discipline once monetary union starts, as well as a means to link any currencies which do not make the grade to the new Euro.</p>
<p>Thirdly, there is the tricky issue of implementing a legal framework for EMU in advance of its expected 1999 start date.</p>
<p>Irish officials, keen to stress the informality of the gathering, took ministers and their partners off to Kitty O'Shea's, one of Dublin's most celebrated bars on Friday evening to begin discussions there.</p>
<p>Countries which want to join EMU in the first round must meet targets on interest and exchange rates, inflation, budget deficits and public debt in 1997, ready for an evaluation of their level of economic integration early in 1998.</p>
<p>European Union economic affairs commissioner Yves Thibault de Silguy told a news briefing as EU finance ministers and central bank governors started to arrive on Friday that the stability pact was &quot;essential for the stability of the Euro&quot;.</p>
<p>A new European exchange rate mechanism, commonly referred to as the ERM II, was needed &quot;to avoid dividing Europe by having currencies which are simply left outside&quot;, he added.</p>
<p>Among the three topics on the agenda, the stability pact has been cast as the centre-piece of the meeting, with recent progress on the issue by the EU's monetary committee setting the stage for a comprehensive deal later this year.</p>
<p>The pact would punish delinquent states with fines if their deficits run out of control.</p>
