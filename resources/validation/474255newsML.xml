<headline>HSBC opens Brazil subsidiary after deal.</headline>

<p>HSBC Holdings Plc, which on Wednesday acquired some of the assets and obligations of Bamerindus, said it set up a new, fully owned subsidiary in Brazil.</p>
<p>Michael Geoghegan, the president of the new bank, said the HSBC subsidiary would operate under the name Banco HSBC Bamerindus SA. Its base will be Curitiba in the Brazilian state Parana, the former headquarters of Bamerindus.</p>
<p>Geoghegan said no layoffs were planned at present.  </p>
<p>&quot;This is a huge commitment we have made to Brazil, and we intend to build on the franchise we have purchased,&quot; Geoghegan said in a news conference. He said a HSBC team was already working on a three-year plan for the bank.</p>
<p>Geoghegan said the bank would open its doors on Monday. Former Bamerindus customers would have normal access to their accounts and could use their checks and ATM cards as usual.</p>
<p>Brazil's central bank on Wednesday said it took over the management of Bamerindus, until recently Brazil's fourth-largest bank, and froze the assets of its main shareholder, Senator Jose Andrade Vieira.  </p>
<p>Central bank authorities announced they had accepted an HSBC offer to assume Bamerindus' assets and liabilities and convert the business into a new bank with an immediate $1.0 billion capital injection.</p>
<p>Geoghegan said $400 million of the total $1.0 billion cash injection would pay for goodwill and some of Bamerindus' intangible assets, including its brand name and trademarks.</p>
<p>HSBC, which had a five percent stake in Bamerindus, made a decision to invest heavily in Brazil because it saw great opportunities in retail banking there.</p>
