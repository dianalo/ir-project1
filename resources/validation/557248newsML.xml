<p>A tidal wave swept Tony Blair's new-look Labour party back to power on Friday for the first time since 1979 as Britain rose in revolt against 18 years of Conservative rule that changed the face of the country.</p>
<p>The defeat was on a scale unseen for 165 years, as a string of top Conservatives including Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind and Defence Secretary Michael Portillo lost their seats.</p>
<p>&quot;It's become pretty apparent that a tidal wave has burst over the Conservative Party tonight. It wasn't a question of putting your hand in the dyke, it was a question of the sea wall collapsing all around you,&quot; David Mellor, one of a string of prominent Conservative casualties, said.</p>
<p>Labour clinched victory shortly after 0200 GMT when it won its 330th seat. The Conservatives had won just 38 by that stage.</p>
<p>Computer projections said this put Blair on course for a majority of about 200 in the 659-seat parliament -- dwarfing its 144-seat majority in 1945 and representing the biggest margin of victory since 1832.</p>
<p>The defeat for Portillo, a leading light of the Conservative right wing, threw wide open the leadership contest that will take place if, as expected, Prime Minister John Major quits.</p>
<p>Other leading Conservatives to lose their seats included Trade Secretary Ian Lang and Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth.</p>
<p>The extent of the landslide had been predicted by opinion polls but, after the polls had failed to anticipate Major's come-from-behind victorty in 1992, no one had believed them.</p>
<p>Conservatives were shocked by the wipe-out, which left the party without any members of parliament in Scotland. But they were not too shocked to start looking for scapegoats.</p>
<p>Nicholas Winterton, a Euro-sceptic opposed to closer ties with Brussels, blamed finance minister Kenneth Clarke for refusing to rule out the possibility that Britain might one day join the European Union's planned single currency.</p>
<p>&quot;He will be remembered, even reviled in history for his actions,&quot; Winterton said.</p>
<p>But the Tory Reform Group, which represents the left-wing of the party, blamed the &quot;rank treachery&quot; of Conservative right-wingers, who it said had &quot;run a vile campaign of hatred against John Major and his administration&quot;.</p>
<p>The astonishing statement, issued even before half the results were known, laid bare the deep divisions over Europe that have dogged Major's 6-1/2 years as prime minister.</p>
<p>Blair, 43, a telegenic moderate who has dumped Labour's left-wing ballast and anchored it in the political mainstream, will be Britain's youngest prime minister this century.</p>
<p>Blair choked back tears in an acceptance speech after he held the safe seat of Sedgefield in north-east England.</p>
<p>&quot;You have put your trust in me and I intend to repay that trust. I will not let you down,&quot; Blair said. &quot;We are a great country, the British people are a great people. There is no greater honour than to serve them, and serve them we will.&quot;</p>
<p>Blair's wife Cherie clutched her husband's hand as the result was read out. As the Labour leader stepped down from the stage, he swept his young daughter into his arms before embracing his two sons.</p>
<p>The centre-left Liberal Democrats, Britain's third party, strengthened their hold on southwest England by capturing a string of seats from the Conservatives.</p>
<p>The BBC projected the Lib Dems, which promised to raise taxes to improve Britain's schools, could win up to 60 seats -- triple the 20 they won at the 1992 election -- to deliver the great breakthrough promised by party leader Paddy Ashdown.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the mood of the country was for a change after 18 years in power,&quot; Sir David Steel, former Lib-Dem leader, said.</p>
<p>Another notable result was BBC war reporter Martin Bell's easy victory in the northwest seat of Tatton against former Conservative minister Neil Hamilton, whose failure to shake off allegations of sleaze prompted Bell to stand as an independent.</p>
<p>Over 18 years, first under &quot;Iron Lady&quot; Margaret Thatcher and then under Major, the Conservatives transformed Britain, halting decades of relative economic decline by taming powerful trade unions and privatising vast swathes of industry.</p>
<p>Major's appeal to voters was &quot;better the devil you know than the devil you don't&quot;, but deep divisions over Europe, broken promises over tax and allegations of sleaze in the ruling party meant he had a Herculean task.</p>
<p>The landslide was a ringing endorsement for Blair's crusade, since he became Labour leader in 1993, to dump the left-wing policies that led it to four successive election defeats.</p>
<p>Blair has promised change -- but not too much change -- with a number of limited but specific commitments that some commentators have dubbed Conservatism with a human face.</p>
