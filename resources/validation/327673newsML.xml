<p>Troops killed more than 50 civilians in Rwanda in a crackdown this week triggered by the slaying of three Spanish aid workers, residents and aid sources said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Rwandan Vice-President Major-General Paul Kagame in Kigali told the British Broadcasting Corporation 80 people were killed in army search operations in Ruhengeri prefecture in the northwest and any civilians among them had been caught in crossfire.</p>
<p>&quot;Rwandan soldiers shot 20 civilians to death at six o'clock in the evening on Tuesday behind the communal office in Kigombe,&quot; Theogene Buradiyo, secretary at the communal office in neighbouring Mukingo in Ruhengeri prefecture, told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;Rwandan soldiers have been hitting the local population hard.&quot;</p>
<p>He said local residents had presented a list of more than 20 missing people to the communal office at Mukingo this week.</p>
<p>Aid sources in Ruhengeri quoted local eyewitnesses as saying more than 30 civilians were killed by Rwandan troops in Mukingo on Wednesday afternoon. They said they feared the final toll from the army sweep in Ruhengeri would be much higher than 50.</p>
<p>They said a large number of civilians were killed in at least six other cordon and search operations by troops in Ruhengeri prefecture on Tuesday and Wednesday but they had no U.N. human rights monitors and local residents reported other violent incidents this week in the communes of Butaro, Kidaho, Kinigi, Nyamugali, Cyabingo, Nyakinama and Gatonde in Ruhengeri.</p>
<p>The Tutsi-led army launched its crackdown in the northwest after suspected Hutu militiamen killed three Spanish aid workers in Ruhengeri in cold blood in Ruhengeri on Saturday night.</p>
<p>An American aid worker was shot in one of his legs which was amputated. The aid workers' killings followed a series of attacks on survivors of the 1994 genocide and Hutu witnesses to the killings who had returned to Rwanda in November and December.</p>
<p>The attacks were apparently aimed at stopping witnesses testifying at trials against suspects accused of genocide.</p>
<p>&quot;We are confirming these operations but as to the killing of civilians I do not have that information,&quot; said Defence Ministry spokesman Emmanuel Ndahiro, adding the army had not killed the aid workers.</p>
<p>State-run radio said on Thursday two genocide suspects had committed suicide at Gisenyi prison in northwestern Rwanda on Tuesday by strangling themselves with their clothes in a latrine.</p>
<p>At Runigi church, 12 km (seven miles) southwest of Ruhengeri, Father Samuel Nayigiziki said eight to 10 people were killed by unidentified gunmen in hills behind Nkuli village on Tuesday.</p>
<p>He said parishioners reported possibly up to 50 civilians were also killed at Nymutera, 10 km (six miles) south of Ruhengeri.</p>
<p>&quot;We are dealing with some rough people,&quot; army Captain Frank Ndore told Reuters in Ruhengeri. &quot;We had a cordon and search operation in town yesterday and one person was killed on Wednesday night in town.</p>
<p>&quot;We are trying to pin these people down in the whole of Ruhengeri,&quot; said the captain, adding operations ceased by Thursday afternoon. He declined to comment when asked if civilians were killed in the sweep.</p>
<p>Large numbers of troops remained on the streets of Ruhengeri town on Thursday. The northeast was a stronghold of the Hutu government in power during the genocide of an estimated 800,000 Tutsis and Hutu moderates by Hutu troops, militiamen and mobs.</p>
