<title>ITALY: Italian bonds/futures.</title>

<p>Italian debt markets failed to sustain a morning rush higher to new peaks and trickled back to waver between soft and steady territory.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is really unbalanced between long term bullishness and short term overbought conditions,&quot; a broker at a London-based futures house said.</p>
<p>The September Btp futures contract on LIFFE went into reverse after clocking up its latest record high of 134.84. By 0945 GMT it was flat at 134.58.</p>
<p>The February 2007 Btp was 13 basis points off at 100.27 after making a record high of 100.45.  </p>
<p>The Feb07 spread over the benchmark Bund was at 115 basis points, not quite as tight as the 111 seen late on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Brokers said the market, after a such a steep run up, might try for a consolidation period for the next few days, given there was a Bundesbank council meeting on Thursday and long and medium term bond auctions in Italy on Friday and Monday.</p>
<p>Expectations for an interest rate cut appear to bubbling beneath the surface with few forecasting the Bank of Italy will cut rates near term but many expecting the 6.75 percent discount rate to fall before the end of the year, which they said would help maintain the market's firm tone.  </p>
<p>The risks on the horizon included problems on the domestic front in welfare reform talks between the government, trade unions and employers, but dealers said the market appeared fairly unbothered by that factor at the moment.</p>
<p>On the technical side, the September future had resistance at 134.75, 134.84 and then 135.00 with support plotted at today's low of 134.30 and then at yesterday's low of 133.75.</p>
