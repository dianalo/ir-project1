<p>International Monetary Fund First Deputy Managing Director Stanley Fischer said on Monday that Asian countries had acted &quot;rapidly and impressively&quot; to deal with the fallout of Thailand's baht crisis.</p>
<p>He told a news conference that currencies in Hong Kong and Singapore should not be vulnerable to external shocks. &quot;These are immensely strong currencies and not very vulnerable in any way that we can see,&quot; he said. They have very good monetary authorities.&quot;  </p>
<p>Asked about the way authorities across the region had reacted to the Thai currency crisis, in which Bangkok was forced to devalue the baht, Fischer said. &quot;The authorities have behaved rapidly and impressively.&quot;</p>
<p>Fischer said the IMF was in touch with the authorities in Indonesia, but he praised the action already taken. &quot;We are quite confident that they know what they are doing and will deal with market pressures in the right ways,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Indonesian rupiah fell to a new low against the dollar on Monday, although it later recovered somewhat after the central bank intervened.</p>
<p>Fischer noted that Malaysia had already started taking action to reduce the current account deficit, while the Philippines, which floated the peso this month, had promised to tighten fiscal policy as part of an IMF loan package.</p>
<p>The IMF, using fast-track rules drawn up after the Mexican financial crisis of 1995, offered Manila $1.1 billion in loans last Friday, extending one program and adding new funds. Fischer said the money would be available this week, whereas it would have taken at least a month to arrange the loan facility if normal IMF procedures had been used.</p>
