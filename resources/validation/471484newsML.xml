<p>Proposals announced by the British government to reform the pension system were slammed as inadequate on Saturday by a right-wing thinktank which said the plans should extend to other state benefits.</p>
<p>The Adam Smith Institute said benefits including unemployment, long-term care and incapacity must be incorporated into the Conservatives' &quot;Basic Pensions Plus&quot; scheme.</p>
<p>&quot;This means the state can focus on its genuine welfare role, instead of mixing it up so thoroughly with savings and insurance schemes that it does all three things rather badly,&quot; said Eamonn Butler, Director of the Institute.</p>
<p>The government unveiled its &quot;Basic Pension Plus&quot; scheme three weeks ago, saying the intention was for the younger generation to build pension funds in their own names which would yield more than the basic state pension.</p>
<p>The present state pension is funded by national insurance contributions paid by taxpayers throughout their working lives.</p>
<p>Under the new scheme, a proportion of national insurance payments will be paid into a fund, which would be invested by insurance companies on behalf of an individual, with the aim of providing a much greater return.</p>
<p>Industry analysts hailed the government's plan, which would take over forty years to phase in, as critical to the future health of the economy. But the Adam Smith Institute called it a &quot;one-way valve&quot; and claimed their package is &quot;for the millions, not the millionaires&quot;.</p>
<p>The Institute said its plan -- which it called the Fortune Account -- would resemble a bank account, and unlike the state pension, funds would be transferable to a person's family if they died.</p>
<p>Butler said the aim was to give people &quot;real choice in how their pension and social insurance needs are met, while the state concentrates on providing a decent welfare net&quot;.</p>
<p>The government has been forced to react to a steady growth in the proportion of elderly people in Britain, which fuelled concern that providing state pensions will prove too heavy a tax burden for the younger workforce in the next century.</p>
<p>&quot;If we moved to a fully funded system, the boost to the economy would be so huge that we could easily make the change in less than a generation and still leave everyone better off,&quot; the Institute said.</p>
<p>The main opposition Labour Party, racing ahead in opinion polls, has outlined plans for a stakeholder pension scheme, in partnership with the private sector.</p>
<p>Pension reform is a key issue for both parties, set to step up their campaigning next week ahead of the May 1 election.</p>
