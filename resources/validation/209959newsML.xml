<headline>Dlr closes higher in U.S., Italy applies to ERM.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-11-22</dateline>

<p>The dollar closed higher, aided by a weaker Italian lira after Italy asked the European Union (EU) if it could rejoin Europe's Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), traders said.</p>
<p>Dollar/mark rose above 1.5060, triggering stop-loss buy orders, after the lira fell against the dollar and briefly fell back below 1000 per mark.</p>
<p>The market was reluctant to continue speculating that the lira would enter the ERM pegged at a central rate above 1000 marks.  </p>
<p>The Italian government does not want the lira to reenter the system at too strong a level because of the adverse effect on its exports, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;They had to sell some of the lira back and I think what has occured is it has created a squeeze in dollar/mark,&quot; said John Gariano, a vice president of foreign exchange at Sumitomo Bank in New York.</p>
<p>The dollar rose to 1.5065/75 marks from 1.5005/15 at the open and to 111.32/42 yen from 111.30/35. It rose to a high near 1,508 lira, from around 1,497.50 in early U.S. trade, before settling near 1504.50 lira.  </p>
<p>The Italian government and European officials said a meeting of the EU's monetary committee, made up of national treasury or central bank officials, was scheduled for 1200 GMT on Saturday to decide the rate at which the lira would reenter Europe's currency grid.</p>
<p>Earlier on Friday, Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi was quoted as saying Italy would return to the grid in a matter of &quot;a few hours or a few days.&quot;</p>
<p>Italy was forced out of the ERM, along with Britain, in 1992 when a severe bout of speculative lira and pound sales nearly tore the system apart.  </p>
<p>Traders have been buying lira for several days speculating that France would demand a strong lira to avoid a flood of inexpensive Italian exports competing with French products.</p>
<p>&quot;It doesn't help the domestic economy if your competitor and neighbor weakens their currency and then gets locked in at that rate,&quot; said Robert Near, a vice president of foreign exchange at Bank of New York.</p>
<p>In European trade on Friday, dollar/mark got a lift from rumors the Bank of France was selling marks against French francs to thwart the recent mark/Paris advance to 3.40.  </p>
<p>Dollar/yen caught some of dollar/mark's updraft but trade was quiet in anticipation of the Bank of Japan's quarterly corporate survey on Wednesday, especially the diffusion index of big manufacturers, known as the Tankan.</p>
<p>The dollar also surged against sterling on Friday, which retreated from Thursday's four-year high amid concerns that a strong pound would hurt British exports.</p>
<p>The pound's slide ended a two-week string of gains against the dollar. Sentiment may have been damaged by complaints from British manufacturers on Friday, dealers said.  </p>
<p>The Financial Times of London reported on Friday that industrial giants like British Steel and chemicals group Courtaulds Plc had expressed concern that the pound was now near a level where it would hurt exports and increase import penetration.</p>
<p>&quot;That, plus Friday profit-taking, seemed to have motivated primarily on sterling,&quot; Near said.</p>
<p>The pound fell to $1.6800/10 from $1.6848/58 on Thursday. The dollar rose to 1.2703/13 Swiss francs, from 1.2672/82 and to Canadian $1.3407/12 from C$1.3382/87. The Australian dollar rose to $0.8142/47 from $0.8112/17.</p>
